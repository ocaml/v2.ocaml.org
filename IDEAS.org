#+STARTUP: showall

* Components
  Here is a list of the main components desired. Details for each
  component are in the following subsections.
  - user accounts
  - wiki
  - documentation
  - list of libraries
  - searching email lists
  - site statistics
  - blog
  - FAQ
  - list external resources
  - aesthetic functional design
  - management structure

  Many features require new code to be written (current plan is to
  implement the site in Ocsigen), and several require well written
  content.

* User Accounts
** Allow authentication via trusted 3rd party sites:
  - [[https://forge.ocamlcore.org/][OCaml Forge]]
  - Google
  - LinkedIn
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Yahoo
  - OpenID

** Maintain minimal profile data to:
  - help us understand community
  - know which institutions have OCaml programmers
  - create map showing where OCaml programmers are based

* Wiki
  IMPORTANT GOALS: support writing tutorial with ease. A comment
  system per paragraph is a plus.

  It will be important to have an editor who monitors the structure
  and quality of the writing on a long-term basis. Else the wiki risks
  being a collection of incoherent text.

** Desired features:
  - Choice of markup (define an abstract interface, implement
    several concrete syntax).  This is VERY URGENT in order to be able
    to develop content while the code is being written.
  - should allow to define external anchors.
  - support structured documentation with sections, subsections, etc.
  - syntax highlighting
  - comment system
  - history of changes
  - export to several formats, e.g. LaTeX, PDF (low priority).
  - It should be easy to merge/move/split pages through the provided interface.
  - comments per paragraph, as in [[http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/][Real World Haskell]]

* Documentation
  There are many forms of documentation. The wiki feature is meant to
  enable user contributed documentation. On the other hand, there is
  much documentation that already exists. At first, we can simply link
  to these other sources, but a better goal is to seamlessly integrate
  into the main site. For example, PDF books should be available in
  html format to help search engines, and possibly provide enhanced
  features like user comments.

** Existing Documentation
   - Books
     - All those listed [[http://caml.inria.fr/about/books.en.html][on inria's site]].
     - Jason Hickey's [[http://files.metaprl.org/doc/ocaml-book.pdf][Introduction to OCaml]]
     - [[http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/][Unix system programming in OCaml]].
     - [[http://thinkocaml.com/][Think OCaml]]
   - [[http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_ocaml/][PLEAC-OCaml]]
   - Absorb content of [[http://mirror.ocamlcore.org/wiki.cocan.org/][ocaml-tutorial.org]].
   - Encourage community to add to wiki, especially content already
     available in other forms elsewhere. Examples:
     - [[http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild][ocamlbuild documentation]]
     - [[http://ambassadortothecomputers.blogspot.com/p/reading-camlp4.html][Jake Donham's blog posts on camlp4]]

* List of Libraries
  - something like [[http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html][hackage]]
  - [[http://oasis.ocamlcore.org/dev/home][oasis-db]] project provides a good starting point
  - may require also automatically pulling information from github and
    ocamlforge

** Desired features
  - provide download links to latest and previous versions of library
  - list methods by which library can be installed, e.g. source, godi,
    debian package, etc.
  - link to API documentation, oasis project will help here
  - support star ranking like Amazon, each user can assign number of
    stars and comment on the library, average starts are shown
  - search, like in Hoogle, there is already a version of this for
    OCaml somewhere...
  - have permanent links to libraries [pages] so we can safely refer
    to them from other pages (e.g. comparing libraries for web
    programming).

* Search Email Lists
  The main OCaml List and Beginner's list are both difficult to search
  over. An improved interface would be nice. In addition, there are
  actually numerous other OCaml related mailing lists (e.g. virtually
  every project on the forge). Should at least link to them and/or
  integrate search over all lists.

  Make it easy to subscribe to mailing lists. Simply check a box in
  your account settings page.

* Site Statistics
  - on the paths (list of links) that people follow would be
    interesting to optimize the site after it is launched
  - register with Google
  - any software that should be installed on web server?

* Blog
  - aggregate related blogs, already provided by [[http://planet.ocamlcore.org/][planet]] but we would
    like to display headlines only on the front page of the site.
  - one new blog where major announcements are made, show this one on
    front page

* FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
  - should be in sections

* List External Resources
  - IRC, create links directly to #ocaml channel via various
    clients.

    [[http://www.mibbit.com/][mibbit]] might be interesting for newcomers. Firefox proposes it
    when one clicks on the URL in index.html. Freenode does not seem
    to be available though.

  - Reddit
  - Stack Overflow

* Design
  - get funding for professional designer
  - clean design but not austere
  - should support dynamic features where appropriate, but work
    gracefully when javascript not enabled
  - should also look good and be functional on mobile devices (lower priority)
  - examples of sites for inspiration: [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]],
    [[http://www.mongodb.org/][mongoDB]], [[http://drupal.org/][Drupal]],
    [[http://www.perl.org/][Perl]]
  - random eye-catching ideas: [[http://www.wordle.net/][word clouds]], [[http://www.highcharts.com/][charts]]

* Management Structure
  - site is managed by a non-profit organization to be created
  - site content is enriched by the community with a mediation on the content by managers
