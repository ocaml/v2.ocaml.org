This page describes OCaml version **3.12.1**, released on 2011-07-04. Go
[here](./) for the latest OCaml release and
[here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/) for earlier releases.

## What's New
Some of the highlights in release 3.12 are:

* Polymorphic recursion is supported, using explicit type declarations
 on the recursively-defined identifiers.
* First-class modules: module expressions can be embedded as values of
 the core language, then manipulated like any other first-class
 value, then projected back to the module level.
* New operator to modify a signature a posteriori:
 `S with   type t := tau` denotes signature `S` where the `t` type
 component is removed and substituted by the type `tau` elsewhere.
* New notations for record expressions and record patterns: `{ lbl }`
 as shorthand for `{ lbl = lbl }`, and `{ ...; _ }` marks record
 patterns where some labels were intentionally omitted.
* Local open `let open   ... in ...` now supported by popular demand.
* Type variables can be bound as type parameters to functions; such
 types are treated like abstract types within the function body, and
 like type variables (possibly generalized) outside.
* The `module type of` construct enables to recover the module type of
 a given module.
* Explicit method override using the `method!` keyword, with
 associated warnings and errors.

## ![](../img/source.gif "")Source distribution
* [Source
 tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12.1.tar.gz)
 (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
 and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
* Also available in
 [.tar.bz2](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12.1.tar.bz2)
 format.
* You also have read-only [SVN access](svn.html) to the working
 sources and to all previous public releases.

The [INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/notes/INSTALL)
file of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instruction.

## ![](../img/freebsd.gif "")Precompiled binaries for FreeBSD
Use binary packages provided by the FreeBSD project. Further information
about the FreeBSD packages is available at
[FreshPorts](http://www.freshports.org/lang/ocaml).

## ![](../img/linux.gif "")Precompiled binaries for Linux
* [RPM packages](http://rpm.nogin.org/ocaml.html) for Fedora, RedHat,
 Mandriva. (Contributed by Aleksey Nogin.)
* [Debian packages](http://packages.debian.org/ocaml).
* [Gentoo
 packages](http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=dev-lang;name=ocaml).

## ![](../img/macos.gif "")Precompiled binaries for MacOS X
Binary package compiled on Mac OS 10.6.4 with XCode tools 3.2.3 (not
compatible with Mac OS 10.4.x):

* [for
 Intel](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12.0-intel.dmg).

## ![](../img/windows.gif "")Precompiled binaries for Microsoft Windows
Four ports of OCaml for Microsoft Windows are currently available. For
additional information, please consult the list of [portability
issues](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/portability.en.html) or the [Windows
release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/notes/README.win32).

* [MinGW-based native Win32 port
 (3.12.1)](http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/). A self
 installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical user
 interface. Some features require the [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)
 environment. However, the compilers generate true Win32 executables,
 which do not require Cygwin to run.
* [Microsoft-based native Win32 port
 (3.12.1)](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12.1-win-msvc.exe).
 A self installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical
 user interface. Some features require Microsoft Visual C++ and
 Microsoft Assembler.
* [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)-based port. Requires Cygwin. No
 graphical user interface is provided. The compilers generate
 executables that do require Cygwin. The precompiled binaries are
 part of the Cygwin distribution; you can install them using the
 Cygwin `setup` tool. Alternatively, download the source distribution
 and compile it under Cygwin.
* Microsoft-based native Win64 port Same features as the
 Microsoft-based native Win32 port, but generates 64-bit code. No
 binary distribution available yet; download the source distribution
 and compile it.

## Precompiled binaries for Solaris
Available at [sunfreeware.com](http://sunfreeware.com/).
