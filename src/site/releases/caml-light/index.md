# Caml Light
## Overview
Caml Light is a lightweight, portable implementation of the Caml
language. that runs on most Unix machines, as well as PC under Microsoft
Windows. Because of its stable status, it is actively used in education.
For most other uses, we recommend switching to its successor OCaml.

Caml Light is implemented as a bytecode compiler, and fully
bootstrapped. The runtime system and bytecode interpreter is written in
standard C, hence Caml Light is easy to port to almost any 32 or 64 bit
platform. The whole system is quite small: about 100K for the runtime
system, and another 100K of bytecode for the compiler. Two megabytes of
memory is enough to recompile the whole system.

Debugging is possible by [tracing function calls in the same way as in
OCaml](../debug.html). In the example therein, one should write
`trace "fib";;` instead of `#trace   fib;;` and `untrace "fib";;`
instead of `#untrace fib;;`. There also exists a debugger, as a user
contribution.

Some common questions are answered in the [FAQ](faq.html).

## Availability
The Caml Light system is open source software, please read its
[license](license.html) for more details. The [latest
release](releases/) can be freely downloaded on this site, together with
its [user&#39;s manual](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-caml-light/).

Light](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/fpcl/index.html) for an
introduction to functional programming in general and the Caml Light
language in particular.
