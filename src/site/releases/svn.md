# Subversion Repository
OCaml is developed using the Subversion (SVN) version control system.
Public read-only access to our Subversion repository is available. It
enables advanced users to track changes and bug-fixes in real-time,
without having to wait for the next release.

Bugs can be reported and followed on
[Mantis](http://caml.inria.fr/mantis).

There is also a [read-only mirror on
GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml), which is automatically
synchronized with the official SVN repository on a regular basis.

## Accessing the repository
The address of the repository is `http://caml.inria.fr/svn`. To check
out a local, working copy of the sources:

```
svn checkout http://caml.inria.fr/svn/dir
```
where *dir* is the subdirectory of interest (see table below).

To update a local working copy with our latest changes:

```
svn update
```
If you are not familiar with Subversion commands, see the
[documentation.](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)

If you do not need a local copy of the sources but just wish to see
changes and their history, you can also [browse the repository via a Web
interface.](http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi)
