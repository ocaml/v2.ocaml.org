*Damien Doligez, Alain Frisch, Jacques Garrigue, Didier Rémy, and Jérôme
Vouillon*

This the official User's Manual. It serves as a complete reference guide
to OCaml. Updated for each version of OCaml, it contains the description
of the language, of its extensions, and the documentation of the tools

###  Real World OCaml
[Book Website](https://realworldocaml.org/) | [O&#39;Reilly Early
Release](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do?code=WKERRLS)

*Jason Hickey, Anil Madhavapeddy, and Yaron Minsky*

Learn how to solve day-to-day problems in data processing, numerical
computation, system scripting, and database-driven web applications with
the OCaml multi-paradigm programming language. This hands-on book shows
you how to take advantage of OCaml’s functional, imperative, and
object-oriented programming styles with recipes for many real-world
tasks.

You’ll start with OCaml basics, including how to set up a development
environment, and move toward more advanced topics such as the module
system, foreign-function interface, macro language, and the ocamlbuild
system. Quickly learn how to put OCaml to work for writing succinct and
readable code.

###  OCaml from the Very Beginning
[Book Website](http://ocaml-book.com/) |
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0957671105)

*John Whitington*

In "OCaml from the Very Beginning" John Whitington takes a
no-prerequisites approach to teaching a modern general-purpose
programming language. Each small, self-contained chapter introduces a
new topic, building until the reader can write quite substantial
programs. There are plenty of questions and, crucially, worked answers
and hints.

"OCaml from the Very Beginning" will appeal both to new programmers, and
experienced programmers eager to explore functional languages such as
OCaml. It is suitable both for formal use within an undergraduate or
graduate curriculum, and for the interested amateur.

###  Unix System Programming in OCaml
[Online](http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/)

*Xavier Leroy and Didier Rémy*

This is an excellent book on Unix system programming, with an emphasis
on communications between processes. The main novelty of this work is
the use of OCaml, instead of the C language that is customary in systems
programming. This gives an unusual perspective on systems programming
and on OCaml. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with OCaml and
Unix shell commands.

 Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998, ISBN 0-521-57183-9
(hardcover) or 0-521-57681-4 (paperback)*

This book uses OCaml as a tool to introduce several important
programming concepts. It is divided in three parts. The first part is an
introduction to OCaml, which presents the language itself, but also
introduces evaluation by rewriting, evaluation strategies and proofs of
programs by induction. The second part is dedicated to the description
of application programs which belong to various fields and might
interest various types of readers or students. Finally, the third part
is dedicated to implementation. It describes interpretation and
compilation, with brief descriptions of memory management and type
synthesis.

###  Concepts et outils de programmation
[Order at Amazon.fr](http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/2729604197)

*Thérèse Accart Hardin, Véronique Donzeau-Gouge Viguié<br />
 InterEditions, ISBN 2 7296 0419 7.*

This book presents a new approach to teaching programming concepts to
beginners, based on language semantics. A simplified semantic model is
used to describe in a precise manner the features found in most
programming languages. This model is powerful enough to explain
typechecking, polymorphism, evaluation, side-effects, modularity,
exceptions. Yet, it is simple enough to be manipulated by hand, so that
students can actually use it to compute. The book begins with a
functional approach, based on OCaml, and continues with a presentation
of an imperative language, namely Ada. It also provides numerous
exercises with solutions.

*Jacques Rouablé<br />
 Eyrolles, Paris 1997, ISBN 2-212-08944-9.*

This book is intended for beginners, who will learn basic programming
notions. The first part of the book is a programming course that
initiates the reader to the OCaml language. Important notions are
presented from a practical point of view, and the implementation of some
of these is analyzed and sketched. The second part, the “OCaml
workshop”, is a practical application of these notions to other domains
connected to computer science, logic, automata and grammars.

###  Apprentissage de la programmation avec OCaml
*Catherine Dubois and Valérie Ménissier Morain<br />
 Hermès Sciences, Paris 2004, ISBN 2-7462-0819-9.*

Programming is a discipline by which the strengths of computers can be
harnessed: large amounts of reliable memory, the ability to execute
repetitive tasks relentlessly, and a high computation speed. In order to
write correct programs that fulfill their specified needs, it is
necessary to understand the precise semantics of the programming
language. This book is targeted towards beginner programmers and
provides teaching material for all programmers wishing to learn the
functional programming style. The programming features introduced in
this book are available in all dialects of the ML language, notably
Caml-Light, OCaml and Standard ML. The concepts presented therein and
illustrated in OCaml easily transpose to other programming languages.
