  <i>Jason Hickey, Anil Madhavapeddy, and Yaron Minsky</i>
  <p>Learn how to solve day-to-day problems in data processing,
    numerical computation, system scripting, and database-driven web
    applications with the OCaml multi-paradigm programming
    language. This hands-on book shows you how to take advantage of
    OCaml’s functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming
    styles with recipes for many real-world tasks.</p>
  <p>You’ll start with OCaml basics, including how to set up a
    development environment, and move toward more advanced topics such
    as the module system, foreign-function interface, macro language,
    and the ocamlbuild system. Quickly learn how to put OCaml to work
    for writing succinct and readable code. </p>

  <i>John Whitington</i>
  <p>In "OCaml from the Very Beginning" John Whitington takes a
    no-prerequisites approach to teaching a modern general-purpose
    programming language. Each small, self-contained chapter introduces
    a new topic, building until the reader can write quite substantial
    programs. There are plenty of questions and, crucially, worked
    answers and hints.</p>
  <p>"OCaml from the Very Beginning" will appeal both to new
    programmers, and experienced programmers eager to explore functional
    languages such as OCaml. It is suitable both for formal use within
    an undergraduate or graduate curriculum, and for the interested
    amateur.</p>

  <h3>Unix System Programming in OCaml</h3>
  <div>
    <a href="http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/">Online</a>
  </div>
  <i>Xavier Leroy and Didier Rémy</i>
  <p>This is an excellent book on Unix system programming, with an
  emphasis on communications between processes. The main novelty of
  this work is the use of OCaml, instead of the C language that is
  customary in systems programming. This gives an unusual perspective
  on systems programming and on OCaml.  It is assumed that the reader
  is familiar with OCaml and Unix shell commands.</p>

  <p>This book teaches OCaml programming with special emphasis on
  scientific applications.  Many examples are given, covering
  everything from simple numerical analysis to sophisticated real-time
  3D visualisation using OpenGL.  This book contains over 800 color
  syntax-highlighted source code examples and dozens of diagrams that
  elucidate the power of functional programming to explain how
  lightning-fast and yet remarkably-simple programs can be constructed
  in the OCaml programming language.</p>

  <p>This book uses OCaml as a tool to introduce several important
  programming concepts. It is divided in three parts.  The first part
  is an introduction to OCaml, which presents the language itself, but
  also introduces evaluation by rewriting, evaluation strategies and
  proofs of programs by induction.  The second part is dedicated to
  the description of application programs which belong to various
  fields and might interest various types of readers or students.
  Finally, the third part is dedicated to implementation. It describes
  interpretation and compilation, with brief descriptions of memory
  management and type synthesis.</p>

  illustrated using OCaml programs. The book adopts a mathematical
  approach: descriptions of mathematical objects are related to data
  structures in the programming language.  This book is suitable for
  students with some mathematical background, and for everyone who
  wants to learn the bases of computer science.</p>

  <i>Thérèse Accart Hardin, Véronique Donzeau-Gouge Viguié<br/>
  InterEditions, ISBN 2 7296 0419 7.</i>

  <p>This book presents a new approach to teaching programming
  concepts to beginners, based on language semantics. A simplified
  semantic model is used to describe in a precise manner the features
  found in most programming languages.  This model is powerful enough
  to explain typechecking, polymorphism, evaluation, side-effects,
  modularity, exceptions. Yet, it is simple enough to be manipulated
  by hand, so that students can actually use it to compute. The book
  begins with a functional approach, based on OCaml, and continues with
  a presentation of an imperative language, namely Ada. It also
  provides numerous exercises with solutions.</p>

  <p>This book is intended for beginners, who will learn basic
  programming notions. The first part of the book is a programming
  course that initiates the reader to the OCaml language. Important
  notions are presented from a practical point of view, and the
  implementation of some of these is analyzed and sketched.  The
  second part, the &#8220;OCaml workshop&#8221;, is a practical
  application of these notions to other domains connected to computer
  science, logic, automata and grammars.</p>

  <h3>Apprentissage de la programmation avec OCaml</h3>

  <i>Catherine Dubois and Valérie Ménissier Morain<br/>
  Hermès Sciences, Paris 2004, ISBN 2-7462-0819-9.</i>

  <p>Programming is a discipline by which the strengths of computers
  can be harnessed: large amounts of reliable memory, the ability to
  execute repetitive tasks relentlessly, and a high computation speed.
  In order to write correct programs that fulfill their specified
  needs, it is necessary to understand the precise semantics of the
  programming language.  This book is targeted towards beginner
  programmers and provides teaching material for all programmers
  wishing to learn the functional programming style.  The programming
  features introduced in this book are available in all dialects of
  the ML language, notably Caml-Light, OCaml and Standard ML.  The
  concepts presented therein and illustrated in OCaml easily transpose
  to other programming languages.</p>
