# Camlp5

Camlp5 is a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for OCaml. It offers syntactic
tools (parsers, extensible grammars), the ability to extend the concrete
syntax of OCaml (quotations, syntax extensions), and to redefine it from
scratch. This is an advanced tool and should not be used by those new to
OCaml.

Unfortunately, there is some confusion between the names Camlp4 and
Camlp5. There are currently two distinct systems with these names.
Camlp4 is part of the standard OCaml distribution and Camlp5 is
distributed separately. The unfortunate part is that what is now called
Camlp5 was formerly known as Camlp4, but what is currently called Camlp4
is unrelated to the former Camlp4 (in terms of implementation, both have
the same purpose).

 that is because it was written prior to the name change.
