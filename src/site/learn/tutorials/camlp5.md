<h1><span>Camlp5</span></h1>

<p>Camlp5 is a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for OCaml. It offers
syntactic tools (parsers, extensible grammars), the ability to extend
the concrete syntax of OCaml (quotations, syntax extensions), and to
redefine it from scratch. This is an advanced tool and should not be
used by those new to OCaml.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is some confusion between the names Camlp4 and
Camlp5. There are currently two distinct systems with these
names. Camlp4 is part of the standard OCaml distribution and Camlp5 is
distributed separately. The unfortunate part is that what is now
called Camlp5 was formerly known as Camlp4, but what is currently
called Camlp4 is unrelated to the former Camlp4 (in terms of
implementation, both have the same purpose).</p>

    change.
