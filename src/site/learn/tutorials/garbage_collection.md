# Garbage Collection

## Garbage collection, reference counting, explicit allocation
As with all modern languages, OCaml provides a garbage collector so that
you don't need to explicitly allocate and free memory as in C/C++.

As JWZ writes in his [&quot;Java sucks&quot;
rant](http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html "http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html"):

*First the good stuff: Java doesn't have `free()`. I have to admit right
off that, after that, all else is gravy. That one point makes me able to
forgive just about anything else, no matter how egregious. Given this
one point, everything else in this document fades nearly to
insignificance. **But...***

The OCaml garbage collector is a modern hybrid generational/incremental
collector which outperforms hand-allocation in most cases. Unlike the
Java GC, which gives GCs a bad name, the OCaml GC doesn't allocate huge
amounts of memory at start-up, nor does it appear to have arbitrary
fixed limits that need to be overridden by hand.

Why would garbage collection be faster than explicit memory allocation
as in C? It's often assumed that calling `free` costs nothing. In fact
`free` is an expensive operation which involves navigating over the
complex data structures used by the memory allocator. If your program
calls `free` intermittently, then all of that code and data needs to be
loaded into the cache, displacing your program code and data, each time
you `free` a single memory allocation. A collection strategy which frees
multiple memory areas in one go (such as either a pool allocator or a
GC) pays this penalty only once for multiple allocations (thus the cost
per allocation is much reduced).

GCs also move memory areas around and compact the heap. This makes
allocation easier, hence faster, and a smart GC can be written to
interact well with the L1 and L2 caches.

Of course none of this precludes writing a very fast hand-allocator, but
it's considerably harder work than most programmers realise.

OCaml's garbage collector has two heaps, the **minor heap** and the
**major heap**. This recognises a general principle: Most objects are
small and allocated frequently and then immediately freed. These objects
go into the minor heap first, which is GCed frequently. Only some
objects are long lasting. These objects get promoted from the minor heap
to the major heap after some time, and the major heap is only collected
infrequently.

The OCaml GC is synchronous. It doesn't run in a separate thread, and it
can only get called during an allocation request.

###  GC vs. reference counting
Perl has a form of garbage collection, but it uses a simple scheme
called **reference counting**. Simply put, each Perl object keeps a
count of the number of other objects pointing (referencing) itself. When
the count falls to zero, nothing is pointing at this object, and so the
object can be freed.

Reference counting is not considered as serious garbage collection by
computer scientists, yet it has one big practical advantage over full
garbage collectors. With reference counting, you can avoid many explicit
calls to `close`/`closedir` in code. For example:

```tryocaml
foreach (@files)
{
  my $io = new IO::File "< $_" or die;
  # read from $io
}
```
This Perl code iterates over a list of `@files`, opening and reading
each one. There is no need to close the `$io` file handle at the end of
the loop. Because Perl uses reference counting, as soon as we reach the
end of the loop, the `$io` variable goes out of scope, so the reference
count on the file object goes to zero, and it is immediately freed (ie.
closed).

Consider the equivalent OCaml code:

```tryocaml
let read_file filename =
  let chan = open_in filename in
  (* read from chan *) in
List.iter read_file files
```
Calls to `read_file` open the file but don't close it. Because OCaml
uses a full garbage collector `chan` isn't collected until some time
later when the minor heap becomes full. In addition, **OCaml will not
close the channel when it collects the handle's memory**. So this
program would eventually run out of file descriptors.

You need to be aware of this when writing OCaml code which uses files or
directories or any other heavyweight object with complex finalisation.

To be fair to full garbage collection, I should mention the
disadvantages of reference counting schemes:

* Each object needs to store a reference count. In other words there's
 a word overhead for every object. Programs use more memory, and are
 consequently slower because they are more likely to fill up the
 cache or spill into swap.
* Reference counting is expensive - every time you manipulate pointers
 to an object you need to update and check the reference count.
 Pointer manipulation is frequent, so this slows your program and
 bloats the code size of compiled code.
* They cannot collect so-called circular, or self-referential
 structures. I've programmed in many languages in many years and
 can't recall ever having created one of these.
* Graph algorithms, of course, violate the previous assumption. Don't
 try to implement the TSP in Perl!

## The Gc module
The `Gc` module contains some useful functions for querying and calling
the garbage collector from OCaml programs.

Here is a program which runs and then prints out GC statistics just
before quitting:

```tryocaml
let rec iterate r x_init i =
  if i = 1 then x_init
  else
    let x = iterate r x_init (i-1) in
    r *. x *. (1.0 -. x)

let () =
  Random.self_init ();
  Graphics.open_graph " 640x480"
  for x = 0 to 640 do
    let r = 4.0 *. (float_of_int x) /. 640.0 in
    for i = 0 to 39 do
      let x_init = Random.float 1.0 in
      let x_final = iterate r x_init 500 in
      let y = int_of_float (x_final *. 480.) in
      Graphics.plot x y
    done
  done;
  read_line ();
  Gc.print_stat stdout
```
Here is what it printed out for me:

```tryocaml
minor_words: 115926165          # Total number of words allocated
promoted_words: 31217           # Promoted from minor -> major
major_words: 31902              # Large objects allocated in major directly
minor_collections: 3538         # Number of minor heap collections
major_collections: 39           # Number of major heap collections
heap_words: 63488               # Size of the heap, in words = approx. 256K
heap_chunks: 1
top_heap_words: 63488
live_words: 2694
live_blocks: 733
free_words: 60794
free_blocks: 4
largest_free: 31586
fragments: 0
compactions: 0
```
We can see that minor heap collections are approximately 100 times more
frequent than major heap collections (in this example, not necessarily
in general). Over the lifetime of the program, an astonishing 440 MB of
memory was allocated, although of course most of that would have been
immediately freed in a minor collection. Only about 128K was promoted to
long-term storage on the major heap, and about another 128K consisted of
large objects which would have been allocated directly onto the major
heap.

We can instruct the GC to print out debugging messages when one of
several events happen (eg. on every major collection). Try adding the
following code to the example above near the beginning:

```tryocaml
Gc.set { (Gc.get ()) with Gc.verbose = 0x01 }
```
(We haven't seen the `{ expression with field = value }` form before,
but it should be mostly obvious what it does). The above code anyway
causes the GC to print a message at the start of every major collection.

## Finalisation and the Weak module
We can write a function called a **finaliser** which is called when an
object is about to be freed by the GC.

The `Weak` module lets us create so-called weak pointers. A **weak
pointer** is best defined by comparing it to a "normal pointer". When we
have an ordinary OCaml object, we reference that object through a name
(eg. `let name = ... in`) or through another object. The garbage
collector sees that we have a reference to that object and won't collect
it. That's what you might call a "normal pointer". If, however, you hold
a weak pointer or weak reference to an object, then you hint to the
garbage collector that it may collect the object at any time. (Not
necessarily that it *will* collect the object). Some time later, when
you come to examine the object, you can either turn your weak pointer
into a normal pointer, or else you can be informed that the GC did
actually collect the object.

Finalisation and weak pointers can be used together to implement an
in-memory object database cache. Let's imagine that we have a very large
number of large user records in a file on disk. This is far too much
data to be loaded into memory all at once, and anyway other programs
might access the data on the disk, so we need to lock individual records
when we hold copies of them in memory.

The *public* interface to our "in-memory object database cache" is going
to be just two functions:

```tryocaml
type record = { mutable name : string; mutable address : string }

val get_record : int -> record
val sync_records : unit -> unit
```
The `get_record` call is the only call that most programs will need to
make. It gets the n<sup>th</sup> record either out of the cache or from
disk and returns it. The program can then read and/or update the
`record.name` and `record.address` fields. The program then just
literally forgets about the record! Behind the scenes, finalisation is
going to write the record back out to disk at some later point in time.

The `sync_records` function can also be called by user programs. This
function synchronises the disk copy and in-memory copies of all records.

OCaml doesn't currently run finalisers at exit. However you can easily
force it to by adding the following command to your code. This command
causes a full major GC cycle on exit:

```tryocaml
at_exit Gc.full_major
```
Our code is also going to implement a cache of recently accessed records
using the `Weak` module. The advantage of using the `Weak` module rather
than hand-rolling our own code is two-fold: Firstly the garbage
collector has a global view of memory requirements for the whole
program, and so is in a better position to decide when to shrink the
cache. Secondly our code will be much simpler.

For our example, we're going to use a very simple format for the file of
users' records. The file is just a list of user records, each user
record having a fixed size of 256 bytes. Each user record has just two
fields (padded with spaces if necessary), the name field (64 bytes) and
the address field (192 bytes). Before a record can be loaded into
memory, the program must acquire an exclusive lock on the record. After
the in-memory copy is written back out to the file, the program must
release the lock. Here is some code to define the on-disk format and
some low-level functions to read, write, lock and unlock records:

```tryocaml
open Unix

(* On-disk format. *)
let record_size = 256
let name_size = 64
let addr_size = 192

(* Low-level load/save records to file. *)
let seek_record n fd =
  lseek fd (n * record_size) SEEK_SET

let write_record record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  write fd record.name 0 name_size;
  write fd record.address 0 addr_size

let read_record record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  read fd record.name 0 name_size;
  read fd record.address 0 addr_size

(* Lock/unlock the nth record in a file. *)
let lock_record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  lockf fd F_LOCK record_size

let unlock_record n fd =
  seek_record n fd;
  lockf fd F_ULOCK record_size
```
We also need a function to create new, empty in-memory `record` objects:

```tryocaml
(* Create a new, empty record. *)
let new_record () =
  { name = (String.make name_size ' ');
    address = (String.make addr_size ' ') }
```
Because this is a really simple program, we're going to fix the number
of records in advance:

```tryocaml
(* Total number of records. *)
let nr_records = 10000

(* On-disk file. *)
let diskfile = openfile "users.bin" [ O_RDWR ] 0
```
Download [users.bin.gz](../img/users.bin.gz) and decompress it before
running the program.

Our cache of records is very simple:

```tryocaml
(* Cache of records. *)
let cache = Weak.create nr_records
```
The `get_record` function is very short and basically composed of two
halves. We grab the record from the cache. If the cache gives us `None`,
then that either means that we haven't loaded this record from the cache
yet, or else it has been written out to disk (finalised) and dropped
from the cache. If the cache gives us `Some record` then we just return
`record` (this promotes the weak pointer to the record to a normal
pointer).

```tryocaml
open Printf

(* The finaliser function. *)
let finaliser n record =
  printf "*** objcache: finalising record %d\n" n;
  write_record record n diskfile;
  unlock_record n diskfile

(* Get a record from the cache or off disk. *)
let get_record n =
  match Weak.get cache n with
  | Some record ->
      printf "*** objcache: fetching record %d from memory cache\n" n;
      record
  | None ->
      printf "*** objcache: loading record %d from disk\n" n;
      let record = new_record () in
      Gc.finalise (finaliser n) record;
      lock_record n diskfile;
      read_record record n diskfile;
      Weak.set cache n (Some record);
      record
```
The `sync_records` function is even easier. First of all it empties the
cache by replacing all the weak pointers with `None`. This now means
that the garbage collector *can* collect and finalise all of those
records. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the GC *will* collect the
records straightaway (in fact it's not likely that it will), so to force
the GC to collect the records immediately, we also invoke a major cycle:

```tryocaml
(* Synchronise all records. *)
let sync_records () =
  Weak.fill cache 0 nr_records None;
  Gc.full_major ()
```
Finally we have some test code. I won't reproduce the test code, but you
can download the complete program and test code
[objcache.ml](_file/objcache.ml), and compile it with:

```tryocaml
ocamlc -w s unix.cma objcache.ml -o objcache
```
## Exercises
Here are some ways to extend the example above, in approximately
increasing order of difficulty:

1. Implement the record as an **object**, and allow it to transparently
 pad/unpad strings. You will need to provide methods to set and get
 the name and address fields (four public methods in all). Hide as
 much of the implementation (file access, locking) code in the class
 as possible.
1. Extend the program so that it acquires a **read lock** on getting
 the record, but upgrades this to a **write lock** just before the
 user updates any field.
1. Support a **variable number of records** and add a function to
 create a new record (in the file). [Tip: OCaml has support for weak
 hashtables.]
1. Add support for **variable-length records**.
1. Make the underlying file representation a **DBM-style hash**.
1. Provide a general-purpose cache fronting a "users" table in your
 choice of **relational database** (with locking).
