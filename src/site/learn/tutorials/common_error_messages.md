# Common error messages
This page gives a list of quick explanations for some error or warning
messages that are emitted by the OCaml compilers. Longer explanations
are usually given in dedicated sections of this tutorial.

## Type errors
###  This expression has type ... but is here used with type ...
When the type of an object is not compatible with the context in which
it is used, it is frequent to obtain this kind of message:

```tryocaml
1 + 2.5;;
```
"This expression has type *X* but is here used with type *Y*" means that
if the contents of the expression is isolated (2.5), its type is
inferred as *X* (float). But the context, i.e. everything which is
around (1 + ...) tells that the gap expects an expression of type *Y*
(int) which is not compatible with *X*.

More disturbing is the following message:

```tryocaml
 This expression has type my_type but is here used with type my_type
```
This error happens often while testing some type definitions using the
toplevel. In OCaml, it is perfectly legal to define a type with a name
that is already taken by another type. Consider the following session:

```tryocaml
type my_type = A | B;;
let a = A;;
type my_type = A | B;;
let b = B;;
a = b;;
```
For the compiler, the second definition of my_type is totally
independent from the first definition. So we have defined two types
which have the same name. Since "a" was defined earlier, it belongs to
the first type while "b" belongs to the second type. In this example,
redefining "a" after the last definition of my_type solves the problem.
This kind of problem should not happen in real programs unless you use
the same name for the same type in the same module, which is highly
discouraged.

###  Warning: This optional argument cannot be erased
Functions with optional arguments must have at least one non-labelled
argument. For instance, this is not OK:

```tryocaml
let f ?(x = 0) ?(y = 0) = print_int (x + y)
```
The solution is simply to add one argument of type unit, like this:

```tryocaml
let f ?(x = 0) ?(y = 0) () = print_int (x + y);;
```
See the [Labels](labels.html "Labels") section for more details on
functions with labelled arguments.

###  The type of this expression... contains type variables that cannot be generalized
This happens in some cases when the full type of an object is not known
by the compiler when it reaches the end of the compilation unit (file)
but for some reason it cannot remain polymorphic. Example:

```tryocaml
let x = ref None
```
triggers the following message during the compilation:

```tryocaml
The type of this expression, '_a option ref,
contains type variables that cannot be generalized
```
Solution: help the compiler with a type annotation, like for instance:

```tryocaml
let x : string option ref = ref None
```
or:

```tryocaml
let x = ref (None : string option)
```
Data of type `'_a` may be allowed temporarily, for instance during a
toplevel session. It means that the given object has an unknown type,
but it cannot be any type: it is not polymorphic data. In the toplevel,
our example gives these results:

```tryocaml
let x = ref None
```
The compiler tells us that the type of x is not fully known yet. But by
using `x` later, the compiler can infer the type ofÂ `x`:

```tryocaml
x := Some 0
```
Now `x` has a known type:

```tryocaml
x;;
```
More details are given in the [OCaml
FAQ](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/FAQ/FAQ_EXPERT-eng.html#variables_de_types_faibles "http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/FAQ/FAQ_EXPERT-eng.html#variables_de_types_faibles").

## Pattern matching warnings and errors
###  This pattern is unused
This warning should be considered as an error, since there is no reason
to intentionally keep such code. It may happen when the programmer
introduced a catch-all pattern unintentionally such as in the following
situation:

```tryocaml
  let test_member x tup =
    match tup with
    | (y, _) | (_, y) when y = x -> true
    | _ -> false;;
```
Obviously, the programmer had a misconception of what OCaml's pattern
matching is about. Remember the following:

* the tree of cases is traversed linearly, from left to right. There
 is *no backtracking* as in regexp matching.
* a guard ("when" clause) is not part of a pattern. It is simply a
 condition which is evaluated at most once and is used as a last
 resort to jump to the next match case.
* lowercase identifiers (bindings such as "y" above) are just names,
 so they will always match.

In our example, it is now clear that only the first item of the pair
will ever be tested. This leads to the following results:

```tryocaml
test_member 1 (1, 0);;
test_member 1 (0, 1);;
```
###  This pattern-matching is not exhaustive
OCaml's pattern matching can check whether a set of patterns is
exhaustive or not, based on the *type* only. So in the following
example, the compiler doesn't know what range of ints the "mod" operator
would return:

```tryocaml
  let is_even x =
    match x mod 2 with
    | 0 -> true
    | 1 | -1 -> false
```
A short solution without pattern matching would be:

```tryocaml
let is_even x = x mod 2 = 0
```
In general, that kind of simplification is not possible and the best
solution is to add a catch-all case which should never be reached:

```tryocaml
  let is_even x =
    match x mod 2 with
    | 0 -> true
    | 1 | -1 -> false
    | _ -> assert false
```
## Problems recompiling valid programs
###  x.cmi is not a compiled interface
When recompiling some old program or compiling a program from an
external source that was not cleaned properly, it is possible to get
this error message:

```tryocaml
some_module.cmi is not a compiled interface
```
It means that some_module.cmi is not valid according to the *current
version* of the OCaml compiler. Most of the time, removing the old
compiled files (*.cmi, *.cmo, *.cmx, ...) and recompiling is
sufficient to solve this problem.

###  Warning: Illegal backslash escape in string
Recent versions of OCaml warn you against unprotected backslashes in
strings since they should be doubled. Such a message may be displayed
when compiling an older program, and can be turned off with the "-w x"
option.

```tryocaml
"\e\n" (* bad practice *);;
"\\e\n" (* good practice *);;

```
