# The Basics
## Comments
OCaml comments are delimited by `(*` and `*)`, like this:

```tryocaml
(* This is a single-line comment. *)

(* This is a
 * multi-line
 * comment.
 *)
```
In other words, the commenting convention is very similar to original C
(`/* ... */`). There is currently no single-line comment syntax (like
`# ...` in Perl or `// ...` in C99/C++/Java).

OCaml counts nested `(* ... *)` blocks, and this allows you to comment
out regions of code very easily:

```tryocaml
(* This code is broken ...

(* Primality test. *)
let is_prime n =
  (* note to self: ask about this on the mailing lists *) XXX;;

*)
```
## Calling functions
Let's say you've written a function - we'll call it `repeated` - which
takes a string `s` and a number `n`, and returns a new string which
contains original `s` repeated `n` times.

In most C-derived languages a call to this function will look like this:

```
repeated ("hello", 3)  /* this is C code */
```
This means "call the function `repeated` with two arguments, first
argument the string hello and second argument the number 3".

OCaml, in common with other functional languages, writes and brackets
function calls differently, and this is the cause of many mistakes. Here
is the same function call in OCaml:

```tryocaml
repeated "hello" 3  (* this is OCaml code *)
```
Note â€” **no** brackets, and **no** comma between the arguments.

The syntax `repeated ("hello", 3)` **is** meaningful in OCaml. It means
"call the function `repeated` with ONE argument, that argument being a
'pair' structure of two elements". Of course that would be a mistake,
because the `repeated` function is expecting two arguments, not one, and
the first argument should be a string, not a pair. But let's not worry
about pairs ("tuples") just yet. Instead, just remember that it's a
mistake to put the brackets and commas in around function call
arguments.

Let's have another function - `prompt_string` - which takes a string to
prompt and returns the string entered by the user. We want to pass this
string into `repeated`. Here are the C and OCaml versions:

```
/* C code: */
repeated (prompt_string ("Name please: "), 3)
```

```tryocaml
(* OCaml code: *)
repeated (prompt_string "Name please: ") 3
```
Take a careful look at the bracketing and the missing comma. In the
OCaml version, the brackets enclose the first argument of repeated
because that argument is the result of another function call. In general
the rule is: "bracket around the whole function call - don't put
brackets around the arguments to a function call". Here are some more
examples:

```ocaml
f 5 (g "hello") 3    (* f has three arguments, g has one argument *)
f (g 3 4)            (* f has one argument, g has two arguments *)

# repeated ("hello", 3);;     (* OCaml will spot the mistake *)
This expression has type string * int but is here used with type string
```
## Defining a function
You all know how to define a function (or static method, for Java-heads)
in our existing languages. How do we do it in OCaml?

The OCaml syntax is pleasantly concise. Here's a function which takes
two floating point numbers and calculates the average:

```tryocaml
let average a b =
  (a +. b) /. 2.0;;
```
Type this into the OCaml "toplevel" (on Unix, type the command `ocaml`
from the shell) and you'll see this:

```tryocaml
  let average a b =
    (a +. b) /. 2.0;;
```
If you look at the function definition closely, and also at what OCaml
prints back at you, you'll have a number of questions:

* What're all those extra periods doing there in the code?
* What does all that stuff about `float -> float -> float` mean?

I'll answer those questions in the next sections, but first I want to go
and define the same function in C (the Java definition would be fairly
similar to C), and hopefully that should raise even more questions.
Here's our C version of `average`:

```
double
average (double a, double b)
{
  return (a + b) / 2;
}
```
Now look at our much shorter OCaml definition above. Hopefully you'll be
asking:

* Why don't we have to define the types of `a` and `b` in the OCaml
 version? How does OCaml know what the types are (indeed, *does*
 OCaml know what the types are, or is OCaml completely dynamically
 typed?).
* In C, the `2` is implicitly converted into a `double`, can't OCaml
 do the same thing?
* What is the OCaml way to write `return`?

OK, let's get some answers.

* OCaml is a strongly *statically typed* language (in other words,
 there's nothing dynamic going on between int, float and string, as
 in Perl).
* OCaml uses *type inference* to work out the types, so you don't have
 to. If you use the OCaml toplevel as above, then OCaml will tell you
 its inferred type for your function.
* OCaml doesn't do any implicit casting. If you want a float, you have
 to write `2.0` because `2` is an integer. OCaml does **no automatic
 conversion** between int, float, string or any other type.
* As a side-effect of type inference in OCaml, functions (including
 operators) can't have overloaded definitions. OCaml defines `+` as
 the *integer* addition function. To add floats, use `+.` (note the
 trailing period). Similarly, use `-.`, `*.`, `/.` for other float
 operations.
* OCaml doesn't have a `return` keyword - the last expression in a
 function becomes the result of the function automatically.

We will present more details in the following sections and chapters.

## Basic types
The basic types in OCaml are:

```
OCaml type     Range

int            31-bit signed int (roughly +/- 1 billion) on 32-bit processors,
               or 63-bit signed int on 64-bit processors
float          IEEE double-precision floating point, equivalent to C's double
bool           A boolean, written either true or false
char           An 8-bit character
string         A string
unit           Written as ()
```
OCaml uses one of the bits in an `int` internally in order to be able to
automatically manage the memory use (garbage collection). This is why
the basic `int` is 31 bits, not 32 bits (63 bits if you're using a 64
bit platform). In practice this isn't an issue except in a few
specialised cases. For example if you're counting things in a loop, then
OCaml limits you to counting up to 1 billion instead of 2 billion. This
isn't going to be a problem because if you're counting things close to
this limit in any language, then you ought to be using bignums (the
`Nat` and `Big_int` modules in OCaml). However if you need to do things
such as processing 32 bit types (eg. you're writing crypto code or a
network stack), OCaml provides a `nativeint` type which matches the
native integer type for your platform.

OCaml doesn't have a basic unsigned integer type, but you can get the
same effect using `nativeint`. As far as I can tell OCaml doesn't have
single-precision floating point numbers at all.

OCaml provides a `char` type which is used for characters, written `'x'`
for example. Unfortunately the `char` type does not support Unicode or
UTF-8. This is a serious flaw in OCaml which should be fixed, but for
the time being there are [comprehensive Unicode
libraries](http://camomile.sourceforge.net/ "http://camomile.sourceforge.net/")
which work around it.

Strings are not just lists of characters. They have their own, more
efficient internal representation.

The `unit` type is sort of like `void` in C, but we'll talk about it
more below.

## Implicit vs. explicit casts
In C-derived languages ints get promoted to floats in certain
circumstances. For example if you write `1 + 2.5` then the first
argument (which is an integer) is promoted to a floating point number,
and the result is also a floating point number. It's as if you had
written `((double) 1) + 2.5`, but all done implicitly.

OCaml never does implicit casts like this. In OCaml, `1 + 2.5` is a type
error. The `+` operator in OCaml requires two ints as arguments, and
here we're giving it an int and a float, so it reports this error:

```tryocaml
1 + 2.5;;
```
(In the "translated from the French" language of OCaml error messages
this means "you put a float here, but I was expecting an int").

To add two floats together you need to use a different operator, `+.`
(note the trailing period).

OCaml doesn't promote ints to floats automatically so this is also an
error:

```tryocaml
1 +. 2.5
```
Here OCaml is now complaining about the first argument.

What if you actually want to add an integer and a floating point number
together? (Say they are stored as `i` and `f`). In OCaml you need to
explicitly cast:

```tryocaml
(float_of_int i) +. f
```
`float_of_int` is a function which takes an `int` and returns a `float`.
There are a whole load of these functions, called such things as
`int_of_float`, `char_of_int`, `int_of_char`, `string_of_int` and so on,
and they mostly do what you expect.

Since converting an `int` to a `float` is a particularly common
operation, the `float_of_int` function has a shorter alias: the above
example could simply have been written

```tryocaml
float i +. f
```
(Note that unlike C, it is perfectly valid in OCaml for a type and a
function to have the same name.)

###  Is implicit or explicit casting better?
You might think that these explicit casts are ugly, time-consuming even,
and you have a point, but there are at least two arguments in their
favour. Firstly, OCaml needs this explicit casting to be able to do type
inference (see below), and type inference is such a wonderful
time-saving feature that it easily offsets the extra keyboarding of
explicit casts. Secondly, if you've spent time debugging C programs
you'll know that (a) implicit casts cause errors which are hard to find,
and (b) much of the time you're sitting there trying to work out where
the implicit casts happen. Making the casts explicit helps you in
debugging. Thirdly, some casts (particularly int \<-\> float) are
actually very expensive operations. You do yourself no favours by hiding
them.

## Ordinary functions and recursive functions
Unlike in C-derived languages, a function isn't recursive unless you
explicitly say so by using `let rec` instead of just `let`. Here's an
example of a recursive function:

```tryocaml
let rec range a b =
  if a > b then []
  else a :: range (a+1) b
```
Notice that `range` calls itself.

The only difference between `let` and `let rec` is in the scoping of the
function name. If the above function had been defined with just `let`,
then the call to `range` would have tried to look for an existing
(previously defined) function called `range`, not the
currently-being-defined function. Using `let` (without `rec`) allows you
to re-define a value in terms of the previous definition. For example:

```tryocaml
let positive_sum a b = 
  let a = max a 0
  and b = max b 0 in
  a + b
```
This redefinition hides the previous "bindings" of `a` and `b` from the
function definition. In some situations coders prefer this pattern to
using a new variable name (`let a_pos = max a 0`) as it makes the old
binding inaccessible, so that only the latest values of a and b are
accessible.

There is no performance difference between functions defined using `let`
and functions defined using `let rec`, so if you prefer you could always
use the `let rec` form and get the same semantics as C-like languages.

## Types of functions
Because of type inference you will rarely if ever need to explicitly
write down the type of your functions. However, OCaml often prints out
what it thinks are the types of your functions, so you need to know the
syntax for this. For a function `f` which takes arguments `arg1`,
`arg2`, ... `argn`, and returns type `rettype`, the compiler will print:

```ocaml
f : arg1 -> arg2 -> ... -> argn -> rettype
```
The arrow syntax looks strange now, but when we come to so-called
"currying" later you'll see why it was chosen. For now I'll just give
you some examples.

Our function `repeated` which takes a string and an integer and returns
a string has type:

```ocaml
repeated : string -> int -> string
```
Our function `average` which takes two floats and returns a float has
type:

```ocaml
average : float -> float -> float
```
The OCaml standard `int_of_char` casting function:

```ocaml
int_of_char : char -> int
```
If a function returns nothing (`void` for C and Java programmers), then
we write that it returns the `unit` type. Here, for instance, is the
OCaml equivalent of `fputc`:

```ocaml
output_char : out_channel -> char -> unit
```
###  Polymorphic functions
Now for something a bit stranger. What about a function which takes
*anything* as an argument? Here's a odd function which takes an
argument, but just ignores it and always returns 3:

```tryocaml
let give_me_a_three x = 3
```
What is the type of this function? In OCaml we use a special placeholder
to mean "any type you fancy". It's a single quote character followed by
a letter. The type of the above function would normally be written:

```ocaml
give_me_a_three : 'a -> int
```
where `'a` really does mean any type. You can, for example, call this
function as `give_me_a_three "foo"` or `give_me_a_three 2.0` and both
are quite valid expressions in OCaml.

It won't be clear yet why polymorphic functions are useful, but they are
very useful and very common, and so we'll discuss them later on. (Hint:
polymorphism is kind of like templates in C++ or generics in Java 1.5).

## Type inference
So the theme of this tutorial is that functional languages have many
Really Cool Features, and OCaml is a language which has all of these
Really Cool Features stuffed into it at once, thus making it a very
practical language for real programmers to use. But the odd thing is
that most of these cool features have nothing to do with "functional
programming" at all. In fact, I've come to the first Really Cool
Feature, and I still haven't talked about why functional programming is
called "functional". Anyway, here's the first Really Cool Feature: type
inference.

Simply put: you don't need to declare the types of your functions and
variables, because OCaml will just work them out for you.

In addition OCaml goes on to check all your types match up (even across
different files).

But OCaml is also a practical language, and for this reason it contains
backdoors into the type system allowing you to bypass this checking on
the rare occasions that it is sensible to do this. Only gurus will
probably need to bypass the type checking.

Let's go back to the `average` function which we typed into the OCaml
toplevel:

```tryocaml
let average a b =
  (a +. b) /. 2.0
```
Mirabile dictu! OCaml worked out all on its own that the function takes
two `float` arguments and returns a `float`.

How did it do this? Firstly it looks at where `a` and `b` are used,
namely in the expression `(a +. b)`. Now, `+.` is itself a function
which always takes two `float` arguments, so by simple deduction, `a`
and `b` must both also have type `float`.

Secondly, the `/.` function returns a `float`, and this is the same as
the return value of the `average` function, so `average` must return a
`float`. The conclusion is that `average` has this type signature:

```ocaml
average : float -> float -> float
```
Type inference is obviously easy for such a short program, but it works
even for large programs, and it's a major time-saving feature because it
removes a whole class of errors which cause segfaults,
`NullPointerException`s and `ClassCastException`s in other languages (or
important but often ignored runtime warnings, as in Perl).
