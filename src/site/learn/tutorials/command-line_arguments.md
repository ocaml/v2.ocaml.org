# Command-line arguments
This is a short tutorial for those who are writing their first OCaml
program and are wondering how to read arguments that are passed on the
command line.

## argv
Like in the C programming language, the arguments that are passed to a
given program are stored in an array. Following the tradition, this
array is named `argv`. It is found in the `Sys` module of the standard
library, therefore its full name is `Sys.argv`. The number of arguments
including the name of the program itself is simply the length of the
array. It is obtained using the `Array.length` function.

## Simple example
The following program displays the arguments with their position in
`Sys.argv`:

```tryocaml
open Printf

let () =
  for i = 0 to Array.length Sys.argv - 1 do
    printf "[%i] %s\n" i Sys.argv.(i)
  done
```
If you save the program above as `args.ml`, and run
`ocaml args.ml arg1 arg2 arg3`, here is what you get:

```tryocaml
[0] args.ml
[1] arg1
[2] arg2
[3] arg3
```
Note that `ocaml` launched a subprocess that actually runs the program
where argv is `args.ml arg1 arg2 arg3`. You can also compile your
program using `ocamlopt -o args args.ml`, and then run
`./args arg1 arg2 arg3` and you will get:

```tryocaml
[0] ./args
[1] arg1
[2] arg2
[3] arg3
```
## Tools for parsing command-line options
A few libraries exist that let you process command-line arguments
without having to scan the `Sys.argv` array yourself:

* `Arg` is a module of the standard library.
* `Getopt` for OCaml is similar to [GNU
 getopt](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html "http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html").
* The
 [Pa_arg](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ebreck/pa_arg/ "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ebreck/pa_arg/")
 library offers a convenient syntax for defining and reading options.
