# File manipulation
This is a guide to basic file manipulation in OCaml using only what the
standard library provides.

Official documentation for the modules of interest:
[Pervasives](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html "http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html"),
[Printf](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Printf.html "http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Printf.html").

The standard library doesn't provide functions that directly read a file
into a string or save a string into a file. Such functions can be found
in third-party libraries such as
[Extlib](http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/ "http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/").
See [Std.input_file and
Std.output_file](http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/doc/Std.html "http://ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net/doc/Std.html").

## Buffered channels
The normal way of opening a file in OCaml returns a **channel**. There
are two kinds of channels:

* channels that write to a file: type `out_channel`
* channels that read from a file: type `in_channel`

###  Writing
For writing into a file, you would do this:

1. Open the file to obtain an `out_channel`
1. Write stuff to the channel
1. If you want to force writing to the physical device, you must flush
 the channel, otherwise writing will not take place immediately.
1. When you are done, you can close the channel. This flushes the
 channel automatically.

Commonly used functions: `open_out`, `open_out_bin`, `flush`,
`close_out`, `close_out_noerr`

Standard `out_channel`s: `stdout`, `stderr`

###  Reading
For reading data from a file you would do this:

1. Open the file to obtain an `in_channel`
1. Read characters from the channel. Reading consumes the channel, so
 if you read a character, the channel will point to the next
 character in the file.
1. When there are no more characters to read, the `End_of_file`
 exception is raised. Often, this is where you want to close the
 channel.

Commonly used functions: `open_in`, `open_in_bin`, `close_in`,
`close_in_noerr`

Standard `in_channel`: `stdin`

###  Seeking
Whenever you write or read something to or from a channel, the current
position changes to the next character after what you just wrote or
read. Occasionally, you may want to skip to a particular position in the
file, or restart reading from the beginning. This is possible for
channels that point to regular files, use `seek_in` or `seek_out`.

###  Gotchas
* Don't forget to flush your `out_channel`s if you want to actually
 write something. This is particularly important if you are writing
 to non-files such as the standard output (`stdout`) or a socket.
* Don't forget to close any unused channel, because operating systems
 have a limit on the number of files that can be opened
 simultaneously. You must catch any exception that would occur during
 the file manipulation, close the corresponding channel, and re-raise
 the exception.
* The `Unix` module provides access to non-buffered file descriptors
 among other things. It provides standard file descriptors that have
 the same name as the corresponding standard channels: `stdin`,
 `stdout` and `stderr`. Therefore if you do `open Unix`, you may get
 type errors. If you want to be sure that you are using the `stdout`
 channel and not the `stdout` file descriptor, you can prepend it
 with the module name where it comes from: `Pervasives.stdout`. *Note
 that most things that don't seem to belong to any module actually
 belong to the `Pervasives` module, which is automatically opened.*
* `open_out` and `open_out_bin` truncate the given file if it already
 exists! Use `open_out_gen` if you want an alternate behavior.

###  Example
```tryocaml
open Printf

let file = "example.dat"
let message = "Hello!"

let () =
  (* Write message to file *)
  let oc = open_out file in    (* create or truncate file, return channel *)
  fprintf oc "%s\n" message;   (* write something *)   
  close_out oc;                (* flush and close the channel *)

  (* Read file and display the first line *)
  let ic = open_in file in
  try 
    let line = input_line ic in  (* read line from in_channel and discard \n *)
    print_endline line;          (* write the result to stdout *)
    flush stdout;                (* write on the underlying device now *)
    close_in ic                  (* close the input channel *) 

  with e ->                      (* some unexpected exception occurs *)
    close_in_noerr ic;           (* emergency closing *)
    raise e                      (* exit with error: files are closed but
                                    channels are not flushed *)

  (* normal exit: all channels are flushed and closed *)

```
