<h2><a name="getting-support"></a>Getting Support</h2>

<p>A great way to get free support is by using the active <a href="mailing_lists.html">mailing lists</a>. When you need to go beyond this and get professional support, you have the following options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/">OCamlPro</a></dt>
  <dd>OCamlPro is an INRIA spin-off that provides professional support on
  OCaml for companies. OCamlPro is a team of highly skilled experienced
  OCaml programmers, including members of the OCaml core development team.
  OCamlPro contributes open-source software to the OCaml
  community, such as <a href="http://try.ocamlpro.com/">Try OCaml</a>
  and the <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com/">OPAM package manager</a>.
  For its customers, OCamlPro can develop specialized software components in
  OCaml, train developers on any OCaml related topic,
  and provide strong expertise to debug and optimize OCaml software and
  support on the OCaml distribution itself. OCamlPro is a member
  of the OCaml Consortium.

  <dt><a href="http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/buero/work_ocaml_search.html.en">Gerd Stolpmann</a></dt>
  <dd>Gerd Stolpmann has been helping companies master OCaml since
  2005. He is an expert of the ecosystem surrounding OCaml and
  developed the <a href="http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/">GODI</a>
  platform. Stolpmann is a computer scientist who has been a
  contractor for several long-running OCaml projects. He has a focus
  on big data (including data preparation, search/query engines,
  map/reduce), but his skills also cover Unix system programming, SQL
  databases, client/server, compiler development (e.g. for
  domain-specific languages), and much more. Also visit his <a

<h3><a id="consortium"></a>The OCaml Consortium at Inria</h3>

<p>The OCaml Consortium federates the design and development of the
OCaml language and its programming environment. The Consortium allow
its members to demonstrate their interest in the OCaml language and
express their support to its development. Moreover, they benefit of a
<a href="consortium/license.html"
   >specific license</a>.</p>

<p>To become a member necessitates a contribution that can be as low
  as 3000€ for a minimal support to OCaml. For more effective
  support, contributions can be of 10000€ or higher. Membership is
  important not only for the development of OCaml, its promotion and its
  dissemination, but also for its continuity.</p>

<h4>How to become a member?</h4>

<p>In order to fully understand the Consortium membership, it is
advised to read the OCaml Consortium membership agreement and its
appendices, which is online as
  <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/agreement.en.pdf"
     >PDF</a>. Extra information about VAT are given in
  this <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/vat.en.html"
	  >information sheet</a>.</p>

  representative, who will then officially send two copies of the
  agreement for signature.</p>

<p>Once the agreement is signed by a representative of your
  company/institution and by a representative of Inria, an invoice will
  be sent to you. </p>



<h3>OCaml Labs</h3>

<p>The goal of <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs">OCaml Labs</a> is to
push OCaml and functional programming forward as a platform, making it
a more effective tool for all users, including significant industrial
users, while at the same time growing the appeal of the language,
broadening its applicability and popularity. This will be achieved by
a combination of technological advancements, creation of community
infrastructure, and public communications. A core principle of OCaml
Labs is that all the work will be freely released under open-source
licenses, and efforts made to integrate work upstream (e.g to INRIA,
who originally developed and have maintained OCaml since its release
in 1996).</p>

<p>You can support OCaml via a charitible donation to OCaml Labs,
which is a project within the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Faculty of Computer Science</a> at the
University of Cambridge. Cambridge is a registered Charity and
donations are often a tax-efficient and effective way to help expand
your organisation's use of functional programming and ensure the
long-term future of OCaml. If you'd like to discuss making a donation,
please contact <a href="mailto:anil@recoil.org?subject=Donating&nbsp;to&nbsp;
OCaml&nbsp;Labs"> Anil Madhavapeddy</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Current Funding</h4>

<p>OCaml Labs is primarily funded by <a
href="http://janestreet.com">Jane Street</a> with a platform grant for
the first three years. It is also supported by <a
