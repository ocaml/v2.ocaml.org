# Commercial Support
## Getting Support
A great way to get free support is by using the active [mailing
lists](mailing_lists.html). When you need to go beyond this and get
professional support, you have the following options:

[OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com/)<br />
OCamlPro is an INRIA spin-off that provides professional support on
OCaml for companies. OCamlPro is a team of highly skilled experienced
OCaml programmers, including members of the OCaml core development team.
OCamlPro contributes open-source software to the OCaml community, such
as [Try OCaml](http://try.ocamlpro.com/) and the [OPAM package
manager](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/). For its customers, OCamlPro can
develop specialized software components in OCaml, train developers on
any OCaml related topic, and provide strong expertise to debug and
optimize OCaml software and support on the OCaml distribution itself.
OCamlPro is a member of the OCaml Consortium.

[Gerd Stolpmann](http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/buero/work_ocaml_search.html.en)<br />
Gerd Stolpmann has been helping companies master OCaml since 2005. He is
an expert of the ecosystem surrounding OCaml and developed the
[GODI](http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/) platform. Stolpmann is a computer
scientist who has been a contractor for several long-running OCaml
projects. He has a focus on big data (including data preparation,
search/query engines, map/reduce), but his skills also cover Unix system
programming, SQL databases, client/server, compiler development (e.g.
for domain-specific languages), and much more. Also visit his [website
on OCaml](http://camlcity.org).

## Giving Support
###  The OCaml Consortium at Inria
The OCaml Consortium federates the design and development of the OCaml
language and its programming environment. The Consortium allow its
members to demonstrate their interest in the OCaml language and express
their support to its development. Moreover, they benefit of a [specific
license](consortium/license.html).

To become a member necessitates a contribution that can be as low as
3000€ for a minimal support to OCaml. For more effective support,
contributions can be of 10000€ or higher. Membership is important not
only for the development of OCaml, its promotion and its dissemination,
but also for its continuity.

####  How to become a member?
In order to fully understand the Consortium membership, it is advised to
read the OCaml Consortium membership agreement and its appendices, which
is online as [PDF](http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/agreement.en.pdf).
Extra information about VAT are given in this [information
sheet](http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/vat.en.html).

If you agree with the Consortium clauses, you will then be able to fill
in and send this [adhesion
form](http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/form.en.html). Your request will
be examined by an Inria representative, who will then officially send
two copies of the agreement for signature.

Once the agreement is signed by a representative of your
company/institution and by a representative of Inria, an invoice will be
sent to you.

###  OCaml Labs
The goal of [OCaml Labs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs) is
to push OCaml and functional programming forward as a platform, making
it a more effective tool for all users, including significant industrial
users, while at the same time growing the appeal of the language,
broadening its applicability and popularity. This will be achieved by a
combination of technological advancements, creation of community
infrastructure, and public communications. A core principle of OCaml
Labs is that all the work will be freely released under open-source
licenses, and efforts made to integrate work upstream (e.g to INRIA, who
originally developed and have maintained OCaml since its release in
1996).

You can support OCaml via a charitible donation to OCaml Labs, which is
a project within the [Faculty of Computer
Science](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.
Cambridge is a registered Charity and donations are often a
tax-efficient and effective way to help expand your organisation's use
of functional programming and ensure the long-term future of OCaml. If
you'd like to discuss making a donation, please contact [Anil
Madhavapeddy](mailto:anil@recoil.org?subject=Donating%A0to%A0%0AOCaml%A0Labs)
for more information.

####  Current Funding
OCaml Labs is primarily funded by [Jane Street](http://janestreet.com)
with a platform grant for the first three years. It is also supported by
[Citrix Systems R&amp;D](http://www.xen.org/products/cloudxen.html). There
are also several research grants associated with OCamlLabs:

* RCUK [Horizon Digital Economy Research](http://www.horizon.ac.uk)
 Hub grant,
 [EP/G065802/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G065802/1).
* EU FP7 [Trilogy2](http://trilogy2.eu) project.
