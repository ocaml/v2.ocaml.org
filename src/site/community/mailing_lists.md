    <h3>The official OCaml mailing list: caml-list AT inria.fr</h3>
    <p>
      The OCaml mailing list is intended for all users of the OCaml
      implementations developed at Inria. The purpose of this list is
      to share experience, exchange ideas and code, and report on
      applications of the OCaml language. This list is not moderated,
      but posting is restricted to the subscribers of the
      list. Messages are generally in English but sometimes also in
      French. In 2010, the list has about 1500 subscribers, who
      exchange about 300 messages per month.

    <h3>OCaml Beginners mailing list: ocaml_beginners AT yahoogroups.com</h3>
    <p>
      This list is a place for the mutual aid of those who recognize that
      they're not OCaml gurus yet... everything you wanted to ask about
      OCaml, but were afraid to submit in the more official caml-list AT
      inria.fr, can be asked, answered and discussed here. In early 2004,
      the list has about 300 subscribers, who exchange about 100 messages
      per month.

    <h3>OCaml IRC Channel: irc.freenode.net #ocaml</h3>
    <p>
      This is real-time communication channel, where you can ask for
      help. There are about a hundred users hanging around; don't ask
      if you can ask, just ask, and be patient: not everyone is in the
      same timezone. The IRC Channel can be accessed through a web
      interface or any regular IRC client.
