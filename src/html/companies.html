              a quantitative proprietary trading firm that operates
              around the clock and around the globe. They bring a deep
              understanding of markets, a scientific approach, and

              profitably in the world's highly competitive financial
              markets.<br /> Jane Street is perhaps the largest

              strong team of functional programmers. They use OCaml
              for everything, from research infrastructure to trading
              systems to operations and accounting systems. Jane
              Street has over 50 OCaml programmers and over a million
              lines of OCaml, powering a technology platform that
              trades billions of dollars every day.
