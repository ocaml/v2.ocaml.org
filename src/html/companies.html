          controlling the technology is critical for us, we're
          developing a lot of in-house tools using OCaml to gain
          development time and stability advandages over
          competitors. Using OCaml enables us to quickly develop
          robust software that we need to build our games.

        <i>
	  RunOrg provides non-profits and organizations with a private
	  intranet and public website using a SaaS model.  The
	  application is written entirely in OCaml for two reasons :
	  one is performance, as OCaml generates fast binaries and
	  supports elegant optimization patterns.  <br/>

	  The other reason is that the flexible and powerful
	  compile-time type inference allows massive changes in the
	  code base without causing any bugs, effectively acting as a
	  compiler-generated unit testing suite.  <br/>

	  The software is powered by an open source in-house web
	  framework, <a href="https://github.com/VictorNicollet/Ohm">Ohm</a>
