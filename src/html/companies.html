	OCaml generates fast binaries and supports elegant optimization
	patterns.<br />
	The other reason is that the flexible and powerful compile-time
	type inference allows massive changes in the code base without
	causing any bugs, effectively acting as a compiler-generated unit
	testing suite.<br />
	The software is powered by an open source in-house web framework,

	Sakhalin develops marine charting apps for Apple iPads and

	weather data, anchor monitoring, etc.  The apps have a wide
	range of users, from occasional recreational boaters to
	professional river/harbor pilots that board large freighters.
	They are free to download and try (with a paid upgrade to
	enable all features).  They are written almost entirely in
	Ocaml with a minor amount of glue to interface with IOS API's.
	Ocaml was chosen because it (1) enables the rapid development
	of extremely reliable and high performance software, (2) is a
	mature stable platform, and (3) has a wide range of libraries.
	It was made possible by the great work done by Psellos in
	porting Ocaml to the Apple IOS platform.  Feel free to contact
	Sakhalin if you have any questions about using Ocaml on IOS.
