    <h1>A History of OCaml</h1>


    <p>&#8220;Caml&#8221; was originally an acronym
    for <em>Categorical Abstract Machine Language</em>. It was a pun
    on CAM, the Categorical Abstract Machine, and ML, the family of
    programming languages to which Caml belongs. The name Caml has
    remained throughout the evolution of the language, even though the
    present implementation has no relation with the CAM.</p>

    <p>Caml was first designed and implemented
    by <a href="http://www.inria.fr/index.en.html"
    >Inria</a>'s <em>Formel</em> team, headed
    by <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~huet/" >Gérard Huet</a>.  Its
    development continued within the 
	<a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/">Cristal</a> team, and its
	current successor, <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/">Gallium</a>.
	</p>

    <h2><a name="origin"></a>The Origin</h2>

    <p>The Formel team became interested in the ML language in
    1980–81.  ML was the <em>meta-language</em> of the Edinburgh
    version of the LCF proof assistant, both designed
    by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rm135/" >Robin Milner</a>.
    It was implemented by a kind of interpreter written in Lisp
    by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mjcg/" >Mike
    Gordon</a>, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rm135/" >Robin
    Milner</a> and Christopher Wadsworth.  LCF itself was written
    partly in ML and partly in Lisp. In order to be able to use the
    LCF proof assistant on the various systems in use at Formel at
    that time (Multics, Berkeley Unix on Vax,
    Symbolics), <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~huet/" >Gérard
    Huet</a> decided to make the ML implementation compatible with
    various Lisp compilers (MacLisp, FranzLisp, LeLisp, ZetaLisp).
    This work
    involved <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~cousinea/" >Guy
    Cousineau</a>
    and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/" >Larry
    Paulson</a>. The performance of the ML implementation was improved
    by the addition of a compiler.
    </p>
    <p><a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~cousinea/" >Guy
    Cousineau</a> also added algebraic data types and
    pattern-matching, following ideas
    from <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rm135/" >Robin Milner</a>,
    which he in turn had borrowed from Hope, a programming language
    designed by <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/rb/" >Rod
    Burstall</a>
    and <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm/" >Dave
    McQueen</a>. At some point, this implementation was called Le_ML,
    a name that did not survive. It was used
    by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/" >Larry Paulson</a>
    to develop Cambridge LCF and
    by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mjcg/" >Mike Gordon</a>
    for the first version of HOL, as recalled in
    Gordon's <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mjcg/papers/HolHistory.html"
    >short history of HOL</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Around 1984, three events motivated us to get even more involved in
      the development of ML:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> In Edinburgh, <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/" >Luca
	  Cardelli</a> developed a much faster implementation of ML using
	his <em>Functional Abstract Machine (FAM)</em>.  He also designed his
	own version of the language, known at that time as <em>Cardelli's
	  ML</em>.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rm135/" >Robin Milner</a>
	thought it was a good moment to propose a new definition of ML in
	order to avoid divergence between various implementations. He defined
	the core Standard ML language, which was later complemented by a
	module system designed
	by <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm/"
	      >Dave McQueen</a>.
      </li>
      <li>At the same
	time, <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~curien/"
	>Pierre-Louis Curien</a> developed a calculus of categorical
	combinators, as well as a correspondence between
	lambda-calculus and categorical combinators, which, as noticed
	by <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~cousinea/" >Guy
	Cousineau</a>, could be seen as a compilation technique for
	ML. Indeed, it was quite close to the original implementation
	technique of Edinburgh ML, but could be described, proved
	correct, and optimized in a simple way. This led to the
	definition of the Categorical Abstract Machine (CAM).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This urged <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~cousinea/" >Guy
	Cousineau</a> to develop a new implementation of ML, based on the
      CAM.  However, the language that we ended up implementing was not
      Standard ML, but... Caml.  Why? Our main reason for developing
      Caml was to use it for software development inside Formel. Indeed,
      it was used for developing
      the <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/" >Coq</a> system,
      which, following
      <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~coquand/" >Thierry
      Coquand</a>'s thesis in 1985, became the team's main aim. We
      were reluctant to adopt a standard that could later prevent us
      from adapting the language to our programming needs. In
      particular, Philippe Le Chenadec
      and <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~mauny/" >Michel Mauny</a>
      developed syntax manipulation tools that appeared useful and
      were incorporated into Caml. Synchronizing with the Standard ML
      team before adopting the language modifications that seemed
      useful to us would have introduced too much delay in our
      work. Furthermore, our philosophy was in conflict with that of a
      &#8220;standard&#8221; language, which is not supposed to evolve
      too quickly. We did incorporate into Caml most of the
      improvements brought by Standard ML over Edinburgh ML.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="first-implementation"></a>The First Implementation</h2>

    <p>The first implementation of Caml appeared in 1987 and was further
      developed until 1992. It was created mainly by Ascander Suarez. After
      Ascander left in
      1988, <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/" >Pierre Weis</a>
      and <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~mauny/" >Michel Mauny</a>,
      carried on with the development and maintenance of the system. This
      implementation compiled Caml down to LLM3, the virtual machine of the
      Le_Lisp system.
    </p>

    <p><a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~cousinea/" >Guy
    Cousineau</a> modestly recalls: &#8220;I must admit that when the
    Caml development started, my experience with programming language
    implementation was very limited. Relying on the LLM3 abstract
    machine and on the Le_Lisp memory allocation and garbage
    collection system saved a lot of work but could not lead to high
    efficiency. The CAM model led to fast closure construction and
    good environment sharing but was poor at environment access and
    made optimizations difficult. It also potentially introduced
    memory leaks, since useless values were kept inside
    closures. Also, I had not realized that it was more important to
    have good performance on non-functional programs than on very
    functional ones. Above all, I had overlooked the importance of
    portability and openness.  In spite of these inadequacies, for
    which I am initially responsible, Ascander, Pierre and Michel did
    quite a nice piece of work.&#8221;</p>

    <h2>Caml Light</h2>

    <p>In 1990 and
    1991, <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~xleroy/" >Xavier Leroy</a>
    designed a completely new implementation of Caml, based on a
    bytecode interpreter written in
    C. <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~doligez/" >Damien Doligez</a>
    provided an excellent memory management system. This new
    implementation, known as Caml Light, was highly portable and
    easily ran on small desktop machines such as Macs and PCs. It
    replaced the old Caml implementation and highly helped promote the
    use of Caml in education and in research teams. Its support for
    data streams and its parsing facilities, due
    to <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~mauny/" >Michel Mauny</a>,
    were issued from a continued effort of the Formel team to promote
    syntax manipulation tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Caml Special Light</h2>

    <p>In 1995, <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~xleroy/" >Xavier
    Leroy</a> released Caml Special Light, which improved over Caml
    Light in several ways. First, an optimizing native-code compiler
    was added to the bytecode compiler.  This native-code compiler
    matched or exceeded the performances of the best existing
    compilers for functional languages, and enabled Caml to be more
    competitive performance-wise with mainstream imperative
    programming languages such as C++.  Second, Caml Special Light
    offered a high-level module system, designed
    by <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~xleroy/" >Xavier Leroy</a>
    and inspired by the module system of Standard ML.  This module
    system provides powerful abstraction and parametrization
    facilities for programming in the large.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective Caml</h2>

    <p>Type systems and type inference for object-oriented programming
    has been a hot area of research since the early
    1990's.  <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~remy/" >Didier
    Rémy</a>, later joined
    by <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~vouillon/" >Jérôme
    Vouillon</a>, designed an elegant and highly expressive type
    system for objects and classes.  This design was integrated and
    implemented within Caml Special Light, leading to the Objective
    Caml language and implementation, first released in 1996 and
    renamed to OCaml in 2011.  Objective Caml was the first language
    to combine the full power of object-oriented programming with
    ML-style static typing and type inference.  It supports many
    advanced OO programming idioms (type-parametric classes, binary
    methods, mytype specialization) in a statically type-safe way,
    while these idioms cause unsoundness or require run-time type
    checks in other OO languages such as C++ and Java.</p>

    <p>In
    2000, <a href="http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/" >Jacques
    Garrigue</a> extended Objective Caml with several new features,
    which he had been experimenting with for a few years in the
    Objective Label dialect of Objective Caml. Among these features
    were polymorphic methods, labeled and optional function arguments,
    and polymorphic variants.</p>

    <h2>The rise of OCaml</h2>

    <p>Since the late 1990's, OCaml has been steadily gaining in
    popularity and attracted a significant user base.  In addition to
    impressive programs developed in OCaml, the user community also
    contributed many high-quality libraries, frameworks and tools in
    areas ranging from graphical user interfaces and database bindings
    to Web and network programming, cross-language interoperability
    and static program analysis.  In parallel, the core OCaml
    development team actively maintains the base system, improving the
    quality of the implementation and porting it to the latest
    architectures and systems.</p>

    <h2>Some Close Relatives</h2>

    <p>In addition to these mainstream versions of Caml, one should
      mention many related
      compilers. <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~mauny/" >Michel
	Mauny</a> and <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~ddr/" >Daniel de
	Rauglaudre</a> designed Chamau, which offers unique syntax
      manipulation facilities which are now offered in the Camlp4
      pre-processor for OCaml.</p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Manuel.Serrano/"
      >Manuel Serrano</a>
      and <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/" >Pierre Weis</a>
      created BIGLOO.  Régis Cridlig made Camlot. Jean
      Goubault-Larrecq wrote HimML, which features implicit
      hash-consing and efficient operations on sets and
      maps. <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~emmanuel/" >Emmanuel
      Chailloux</a> published CeML. In the <em>Para</em> team, Francis
      Dupont implemented Caml for parallel machines,
      while <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~maranget/" >Luc
      Maranget</a> built Gaml, a compiler for a lazy functional
      programming language.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Quote</h2>

    <p>In 1996, <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~cousinea/" >Guy
    Cousineau</a> wrote: &#8220;Certainly, the history of Caml could
    have been more linear. However, through trial and error, a
    capacity for producing high performance, portable, and flexible
    functional programming language implementations has emerged in
    France.&#8221;
