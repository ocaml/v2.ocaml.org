Many videos about OCaml can be found on
[vimeo](https://vimeo.com/search?q=ocaml) or
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ocaml).

For OCaml beginners these
[videos](https://vimeo.com/user20888710/videos) by John Whitington
explain basic ideas about OCaml. They are good companion material to
his [books](http://ocaml-book.com/) (the videos do not require or depend
on them though).

Dan Ghica's
[Foundations of Computer Science lectures](http://vimeo.com/user8856528/videos)
use OCaml.

[Caml Trading](http://vimeo.com/14317442) that Yaron Minsky gave at CMU. It explains how the
robustness, efficiency, and expressiveness of OCaml is used to
outperform the competition in the financial world.
