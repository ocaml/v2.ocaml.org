# Mailing lists

###  The official OCaml mailing list: caml-list AT inria.fr
The OCaml mailing list is intended for all users of the OCaml
implementations developed at Inria. The purpose of this list is to share
experience, exchange ideas and code, and report on applications of the
OCaml language. This list is not moderated, but posting is restricted to
the subscribers of the list. Messages are generally in English but
sometimes also in French. In 2010, the list has about 1500 subscribers,
who exchange about 300 messages per month.

###  OCaml Beginners mailing list: ocaml_beginners AT yahoogroups.com
This list is a place for the mutual aid of those who recognize that
they're not OCaml gurus yet... everything you wanted to ask about OCaml,
but were afraid to submit in the more official caml-list AT inria.fr,
can be asked, answered and discussed here. In early 2004, the list has
about 300 subscribers, who exchange about 100 messages per month.

IRC Channel can be accessed through a web interface or any regular IRC
client.
