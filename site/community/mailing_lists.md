# Mailing Lists and Web Forums

Mailing lists and other forums used to discuss OCaml in general are
listed below. There are thousands of other forums related to
individual projects. Several mailing lists are hosted on the
[lists.ocaml.org](http://lists.ocaml.org) domain. Projects on
[GitHub](https://github.com/trending?l=ocaml&since=monthly) actively
use GitHub's Issue system for discussions.

## Web Forums

### Discuss at OCaml.org
[discuss.ocaml.org](https://discuss.ocaml.org/)
This is the most active forum about OCaml. Topics are grouped into
a variety of categories, which can be followed independently.
This forum welcomes people at all levels of proficiency, including
beginners.
A mailing-list mode is also available for those who wish to receive
all messages.

Most categories are in English but categories in other languages are
welcome.

## Mailing Lists

### Official OCaml List
*caml-list AT inria.fr*
The OCaml mailing list is intended for all users of the OCaml
implementations developed at Inria. The purpose of this list is to share
experience, exchange ideas and code, and report on applications of the
OCaml language. This list is not moderated, but posting is restricted to
the subscribers of the list. Messages are generally in English but
sometimes also in French. In 2010, the list has about 1500 subscribers,
who exchange about 300 messages per month.

## Discussion Groups

### IRC Channel - English
*irc.freenode.net #ocaml*
This is a real-time communication channel, where you can ask for help.
There are about a hundred users hanging around; don't ask if you can
ask, just ask, and be patient: not everyone is in the same timezone. The
IRC Channel can be accessed through a web interface or any regular IRC
client.

Public channel logs are available at <http://irclog.whitequark.org/ocaml/>

If you wish to use a web-based IRC client, you can use Freenode's
webchat <https://webchat.freenode.net/>. For a fancier/nicer
interface, you may try
<https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#freenode_#ocaml:matrix.org> -- it
requires registration but is otherwise free.

### Discord Server

[discord link](https://discord.gg/cCYQbqN):
As a more recent addition to the OCaml community, the OCaml discord server benefits from the
proximity of the ReasonML community's discord server, as well as discord's
ability to have multiple channels. One of the channels is called #IRC,
and automatically connects to the main IRC channel.

### IRC Channel - French
*irc.freenode.net #ocaml-fr*
As above, but for French speakers.

### About ML
*comp.lang.ml*
This is a moderated Usenet newsgroup about all variants of ML.
Discussions generally concern Standard ML implementations (such as
SML-NJ), but some threads concern the OCaml branch.

### About Functional Languages
*comp.lang.functional*
This is an unmoderated usenet newsgroup for the discussion of all
aspects of functional programming languages, including their design,
application, theoretical foundation, and implementation. Discussions
concern all families of functional programming languages including
non-strict ones (e.g. Haskell) and strict ones (e.g. Scheme, SML or
OCaml).
