# Support

## Commercial Support
A great way to get free support is by using the active [mailing
lists](mailing_lists.html). When you need to go beyond this and get
professional support, you have the following options:

### [The OCamlPro Company](http://www.ocamlpro.com/)

[OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com/) is the creator of many open-source tools
widely used throughout the community, such as
[Try OCaml](http://try.ocamlpro.com/), the
[OPAM package manager](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/) and
[ocp-indent](http://www.typerex.org/ocp-indent.html), as well as a
large contributor
to OCaml itself. Besides commercially supporting their tools, they offer to
share their expertise through
full OCaml support packages.
They also provide trainings and specialized software developments.

OCamlPro is an INRIA spin-off with a team of highly skilled experienced OCaml
programmers, including members of the OCaml core development team, and they have
expertise to help debug and optimize OCaml projects as well as improve specific
work environments. See details [here](http://www.ocamlpro.com/).

### Gerd Stolpmann
[Gerd Stolpmann](http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/buero/work_ocaml_search.html.en)
has been helping companies master OCaml since 2005. He is
an expert of the ecosystem surrounding OCaml and developed the
[GODI](http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/) platform. Stolpmann is a computer
scientist who has been a contractor for several long-running OCaml
projects. He has a focus on big data (including data preparation,
search/query engines, map/reduce), but his skills also cover Unix system
programming, SQL databases, client/server, compiler development (e.g.
for domain-specific languages), and much more. Also visit his [website
on OCaml](http://camlcity.org).

## Giving Support

### [Caml Consortium at Inria](/consortium/)
You can join the Caml Consortium to support development of the OCaml
compiler itself. See details [here](/consortium/).

### [OCaml Labs](/ocamllabs/)
You can support OCaml Labs, which runs a variety of open source
projects to support the OCaml community. See details
[here](/ocamllabs/).

### [IRILL](http://www.irill.org/)
You can support IRILL, the Center
for Research and Innovation on Free Software, a major actor of the
OCaml community, with projects such as
[js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) (the
OCaml to JavaScript optimizing compiler),
[Dose](https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/dose/) (a key component of the
OPAM package manager). They also use OCaml
to contribute to other major open source projects
([Coccinelle](http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/), for example). 
See details [here](http://www.irill.org/).
