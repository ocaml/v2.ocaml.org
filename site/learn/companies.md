        compiler-generated unit testing suite. The software is powered

The full featured apps display marine charts, GPS and onboard sensor data, Automatic Identification System, weather data, anchor monitoring, etc. The apps have a wide range of users, from occasional recreational boaters to professional river/harbor pilots that board large freighters. They are free to download and try (with a paid upgrade to enable all features). They are written almost entirely in Ocaml with a minor amount of glue to interface with IOS API's. Ocaml was chosen because it (1) enables the rapid development of extremely reliable and high performance software, (2) is a mature stable platform, and (3) has a wide range of libraries. It was made possible by the great work done by Psellos in porting OCaml to the Apple iOS platform. Feel free to contact Sakhalin if you have any questions about using OCaml on iOS.</p>
