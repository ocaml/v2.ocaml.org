# Libraries

There are thousands of OCaml libraries available. Here is a list of
the most popular sites where you can find them.

* [Official OPAM repository](http://opam.ocaml.org) is the first place
  to check. The most high quality and most widely used libraries are
  provided as OPAM packages.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/trending/ocaml) is an extremely popular
  code hosting site and very widely used amongst OCaml
  programmers. Click the link to find OCaml projects. Remember that
  many of these libraries are provided as OPAM packages, so you'll
  have already found them in OPAM. However, there are some
  libraries here that people haven't pushed to OPAM for one reason or
  another.

* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/repo/all/relevance?name=ocaml&language=ocaml)
  is yet another code hosting site. It is far less used amongst OCaml
  programmers, but click the link to find those that are.

* [Caml Hump](http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/hump.en.cgi) is now
 deprecated. For many years, it was the definitive source to search
 for OCaml libraries. It is hosted on the old caml.inria.fr, which is
 being retained because there are many links on the internet pointing
 to this site, but is no longer maintained. You should not rely on it
 for up-to-date information.
