# Compiling C with gcc
The following is a plugin that tries to handle simple C projects with
`gcc` in the same way `ocamlbuild` handles your caml projects, i.e. you
don't need to specify anything particular to build simple executables.
Another approach is to use the
[ocamlbuild-ctools](http://dvide.com/labs/ocamlbuild-ctools) plugin
which provides support for both `gcc` and the MSVC tool chain, but
you'll have to explicitely list object files to link your executables.

The example uses `avr-gcc` to produce `%.elf` executables for
microcontrollers, but it's just a matter of substituting `avr-gcc` with
`gcc` to get the same result for regular C projects. For now the plugin
doesn't handle multiple directories.

Object dependencies linked into a `%.elf` executable are automatically
computed as follows.

1. Each file `%.{c,h}` has a corresponding file `%.{c,h}.depends` that
 lists \(locally\) included files \(this file is generated via
 `avr-gcc -MM -MF -MG %.{c,h}.depends %.{c,h}`\). Note that
 unfortunately the result in `%.{c,h}.depend` is different if
 included files are already in the build dir or not \(very
 helpful...\), see the `correct` function in `parse_deps` \(this
 "feature" may make it a hard to support multiple directories, but I
 didn't research that extensively\). Another problem is that these
 `make` oriented `.depends` files have `\` when lines becomes too
 long thus we need to filter out these.
2. To build a `%.o` from `%.c`, every file mentioned in `%.c.depends`
 and recursively is built \(in the function `parse_deps` the first two
 items of `%.c.depends` are ignored : they are `%.o` and `%.c`\). To
 sum up, this step copies files included in `%.c` \(and recursively\)
 to the `_build` directory and produces the object file `%.o`.
3. To build \(link\) a `%.elf`, we take `%.o` and for each `$.h`
 mentioned in `%.c.depends` \(and recursively\) we try to build a
 corresponding `$.c`, if it succeeds the corresponding `$.o` is built
 and added at the link phase.
