# The traverse tag
Each time ocamlbuild want to traverse a directory, it checks that the
directory is traversable. To do so it applies tagging rules and look for
the **traverse** tag.

If you have a directory that you want ocamlbuild doesn't traverse it,
just remove the traverse tag from it.

`"big_directory_without_sources_for_ocamlbuild": -traverse`

As always with tags, you can also provide a more complex pattern:

`<{foo,bar}/*> and not "foo/src": -traverse`

Of course you can also change default behavior:

`true: -traverse`
