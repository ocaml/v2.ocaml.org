# How to Prove It (humor)

- **proof by example:**
    The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it contains most of the ideas of the general proof.

- **proof by intimidation:**
    'Trivial'.

- **proof by vigorous handwaving:**
    Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.

- **proof by cumbersome notation:**
    Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special symbols.

- **proof by exhaustion:**
    An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.

- **proof by omission:**
    'The reader may easily supply the details'  
    'The other 253 cases are analogous'  
    '...'

- **proof by obfuscation:** A long plotless sequence of true and/or
    meaningless syntactically related statements.

- **proof by wishful citation:**

	The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of a
	theorem from the literature to support his claims.

- **proof by funding:**
    How could three different government agencies be wrong?

- **proof by eminent authority:**
    'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP- complete.'

- **proof by personal communication:**
	'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete
    [Karp, personal communication].'

- **proof by reduction to the wrong problem:**
	'To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is
    decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.'

- **proof by reference to inaccessible literature:**
	The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found in a
    privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian Philological
    Society, 1883.

- **proof by importance:**
	A large body of useful consequences all follow from the
	proposition in question.

- **proof by accumulated evidence:**
    Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

- **proof by cosmology:**
	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

- **proof by mutual reference:**
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in
    reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in
    reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in
    reference A.

- **proof by metaproof:**
    A method is given to construct the desired proof. The correctness of the method is proved by any of these techniques.

- **proof by picture:**
    A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well with proof by omission.

- **proof by vehement assertion:**
    It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the audience.

- **proof by ghost reference:**
    Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in the reference given.

- **proof by forward reference:**
    Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author, which is often not as forthcoming as at first.

- **proof by semantic shift:**
    Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed for the statement of the result.

- **proof by appeal to intuition:**
    Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.
