# Up and Running with OCaml

This page will help you install OCaml, the Dune build system, and support for
your favourite text editor or IDE. These instructions work on Windows, Unix
systems like Linux, and macOS.

## Installing OCaml

There are two procedures: one for Unix-like systems, and one for Windows.

### For Linux and macOS

We will install OCaml using opam, the OCaml package manager.  We will also use
opam when we wish to install third-party OCaml libraries.

**For macOS**

```
# Homebrew
brew install opam

# MacPort
port install opam
```

**For Linux** the preferred way is to use your system's package manager on
Linux (e.g `apt-get install opam` or similar). [Details of all installation
methods.](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)

Then, we install an OCaml compiler:

```
# environment setup
opam init
eval `opam env`

# install given version of the compiler
opam switch create 4.11.1
eval `opam env`
```

Now, OCaml is up and running:

```
$ which ocaml
/Users/frank/.opam/4.11.1/bin/ocaml

$ ocaml -version
The OCaml toplevel, version 4.11.1
```

**For either Linux or macOS** as an alternative, a binary distribution of opam is
available:

```
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
```

### For Windows

We use the [OCaml for Windows](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/)
installer which comes in 32bit and 64bit versions. This installer gives you
opam and OCaml installations all in one go. It is used from within a Cygwin
environment, but the executables produced have no dependency on Cygwin at all.

## The OCaml top level

OCaml comes with two compilers: for native code, and for byte code. We shall
use one of those in a moment. But first, let's use OCaml's top level (sometimes
known as a REPL in other languages):

```
$ ocaml
        OCaml version 4.11.1

# 1 + 2 * 3;;
- : int = 7

```

We typed the phrase `1 + 2 * 3` and then signalled to OCaml that we had
finished by typing `;;` followed by the Enter key. OCaml calculated the
result, `7` and its type `int` and showed them to us. We exit by running the
built-in `exit` function with exit code 0:

```
$ ocaml
        OCaml version 4.11.1

# 1 + 2 * 3;;
- : int = 7
# exit 0;;
$
```

There are two ways to improve your experience with the OCaml top level: you can
install the popular [`rlwrap`](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) on your
system and invoke `rlwrap ocaml` instead of `ocaml` to get line-editing
facilities inside the OCaml top level, or you can install the alternative top
level `utop` using opam:

```
$ opam install utop
```

We run it by typing `utop` instead of `ocaml`. You can read more about
[utop](https://github.com/ocaml-community/utop).

## Installing the Dune build system

Dune is a build system for OCaml. It takes care of all the low level details of
OCaml compilation. We install it with opam:

```
$ opam install dune
The following actions will be performed:
  - install dune 2.7.1

<><> Gathering sources ><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
[default] https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0.7/archives/dune.2.7.1+opam.tar.gz
downloaded

<><> Processing actions <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
-> installed dune.2.7.1
Done.
```

## A first project

Let's begin the simplest project with Dune and OCaml. We create a new directory
and ask `dune` to initialise a new project:

```
$ mkdir helloworld
$ cd helloworld/
$ dune init exe helloworld
Success: initialized executable component named helloworld
```

Building our program is as simple as typing `dune build`:

```
$ dune build
Info: Creating file dune-project with this contents:
| (lang dune 2.7)
Done: 8/11 (jobs: 1)
```

When we change our program, we type `dune build` again to make a new
executable. We can run the executable with `dune exec` (it's called
`helloworld.exe` even when we're not using Windows):

```
$ dune exec ./helloworld.exe
Hello, World!        
```

Let's look at the contents of our new directory. Dune has added the
`helloworld.ml` file, which is our OCaml program. It has also added our `dune`
file, which tells dune how to build the program, and a `_build` subdirectory,
which is dune's working space.

```
$ ls
_build		dune		helloworld.ml
```

The `helloworld.exe` executable is stored inside the `_build/default` subdirectory, so
it's easier to run with `dune exec`. To ship the executable, we can just copy
it from inside `_build/default` to somewhere else.

Here is the contents of the automatically-generated `dune` file. When we want
to add components to your project, such as third-party libraries, we edit this
file.

```
(executable
 (name helloworld))
```

## Editor support for OCaml

For **Visual Studio Code**, and other editors support the Language Server
Protocol, the OCaml language server can be installed with opam:

```
$ opam install ocaml-lsp-server
```

Now, we install the OCaml Platform Visual Studio Code extension from the Visual
Studio Marketplace.

Upon first loading an OCaml source file, you may be prompted to select the
toolchain in use: pick OCaml the version of OCaml you are using, e.g. 4.11.1
from the list. Now, help is available by hovering over symbols in your program:

![Visual Studio Code](/img/vscode.png "")

**On Windows**, we must launch Visual Studio Code from within the Cygwin window,
rather than by clicking on its icon (otherwise, the language server will not be
found):

```
$ /cygdrive/c/Users/Frank\ Smith/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft\ VS\ Code/Code.exe
```

**For Vim and Emacs**, install the [Merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin)
system using opam:

```
$ opam install merlin
```

The installation procedure will print instructions on how to link Merlin with
your editor.

**On Windows**, when using Vim, the default cygwin Vim will not work with
Merlin. You will need install Vim separately. In addition to the usual
instructions printed when installing Merlin, you may need to set the PATH in
Vim:

```
let $PATH .= ";".substitute(system('opam config var bin'),'\n$','','''')
```
