# 99 Problems (solved) in OCaml
This section is inspired by [Ninety-Nine Lisp
Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
which in turn was based on “[Prolog problem
list](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/)”. For
each of these questions, some simple tests are shown—they may also serve
to make the question clearer if needed. To work on these problems, we
recommend you first [install OCaml](/docs/install.html) or use it [inside
your browser](http://try.ocamlpro.com/). The source of the following
problems is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/VictorNicollet/99-Problems-OCaml).

## Working with lists

#### Write a function `last : 'a list -> 'a option` that returns the last element of a list. (*easy*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec last = function
>   | [] -> None
>   | [x] -> Some x
>   | _ :: t -> last t;;
> ```

```ocamltop
last [ "a" ; "b" ; "c" ; "d" ];;
last [];;
```

#### Find the last but one (last and penultimate) elements of a list. (*easy*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec last_two = function
>   | [] | [_] -> None
>   | [x;y] -> Some (x,y)
>   | _::t -> last_two t;;
> ```

```ocamltop
last_two [ "a" ; "b" ; "c" ; "d" ];;
last_two [ "a" ];;
```

#### Find the `k`'th element of a list. (*easy*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec at k = function
>   | [] -> None
>   | h :: t -> if k = 1 then Some h else at (k-1) t;;
> ```

```ocamltop
at 3 [ "a" ; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e" ];;
at 3 [ "a" ];;
```

#### Find the number of elements of a list. (*easy*)

OCaml standard library has `List.length` but we ask that you reimplement
it. Bonus for a [tail recursive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)
solution.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* This function is tail-recursive: it uses a constant amount of
>    stack memory regardless of list size. *)
> let length list =
>   let rec aux n = function
>     | [] -> n
>     | _::t -> aux (n+1) t
>   in aux 0 list;;
> ```

```ocamltop
length [ "a" ; "b" ; "c"];;
length [];;
```

#### Reverse a list. (*easy*)

OCaml standard library has `List.rev` but we ask that you reimplement
it.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rev list =
>   let rec aux acc = function
>     | [] -> acc
>     | h::t -> aux (h::acc) t in
>   aux [] list;;
> ```

```ocamltop
rev ["a" ; "b" ; "c"];;
```

#### Find out whether a list is a palindrome. (*easy*)

HINT: a palindrome is its own reverse.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let is_palindrome list =
>   list = List.rev list
> (* One can use either the rev function from the previous problem, or the
>    built-in List.rev *);;
> ```

```ocamltop
is_palindrome [ "x" ; "a" ; "m" ; "a" ; "x" ];;
not (is_palindrome [ "a" ; "b" ]);;
```

#### Flatten a nested list structure. (*medium*)

```ocamltop
(* There is no nested list type in OCaml, so we need to define one
   first. A node of a nested list is either an element, or a list of
   nodes. *)
type 'a node =
  | One of 'a 
  | Many of 'a node list;;
```

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* This function traverses the list, prepending any encountered elements
>   to an accumulator, which flattens the list in inverse order. It can
>   then be reversed to obtain the actual flattened list. *)
> 
> let flatten list =
>   let rec aux acc = function
>     | [] -> acc
>     | One x :: t -> aux (x :: acc) t
>     | Many l :: t -> aux (aux acc l) t in
>   List.rev (aux [] list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
flatten [ One "a" ; Many [ One "b" ; Many [ One "c" ; One "d" ] ; One "e" ] ];;
```

#### Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements. (*medium*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec compress = function
>   | a :: (b :: _ as t) -> if a = b then compress t else a :: compress t
>   | smaller -> smaller;;
> ```

```ocamltop
compress ["a";"a";"a";"a";"b";"c";"c";"a";"a";"d";"e";"e";"e";"e"];;
```

#### Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. (*medium*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let pack list =
>   let rec aux current acc = function
>     | [] -> []    (* Can only be reached if original list is empty *)
>     | [x] -> (x :: current) :: acc
>     | a :: (b :: _ as t) ->
>        if a = b then aux (a :: current) acc t
>        else aux [] ((a :: current) :: acc) t  in
>   List.rev (aux [] [] list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
pack ["a";"a";"a";"a";"b";"c";"c";"a";"a";"d";"d";"e";"e";"e";"e"];;
```


#### Run-length encoding of a list. (*easy*)

If you need so, refresh your memory about
[run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding).

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let encode list =
>   let rec aux count acc = function
>     | [] -> [] (* Can only be reached if original list is empty *)
>     | [x] -> (count+1, x) :: acc
>     | a :: (b :: _ as t) -> if a = b then aux (count + 1) acc t
>                             else aux 0 ((count+1,a) :: acc) t in
>   List.rev (aux 0 [] list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
encode ["a";"a";"a";"a";"b";"c";"c";"a";"a";"d";"e";"e";"e";"e"];;
```

#### Modified run-length encoding. (*easy*)

Modify the result of the previous problem in such a way that if an
element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only
elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.

Since OCaml lists are homogeneous, one needs to define a type to hold
both single elements and sub-lists.

```ocamltop
type 'a rle =
  | One of 'a
  | Many of int * 'a;;
```

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let encode l =
>   let create_tuple cnt elem =
>     if cnt = 1 then One elem
>     else Many (cnt, elem) in
>   let rec aux count acc = function
>     | [] -> []
>     | [x] -> (create_tuple (count+1) x) :: acc
>     | hd :: (snd :: _ as tl) ->
>         if hd = snd then aux (count + 1) acc tl
>         else aux 0 ((create_tuple (count + 1) hd) :: acc) tl in
>     List.rev (aux 0 [] l)
> ```

```ocamltop
encode ["a";"a";"a";"a";"b";"c";"c";"a";"a";"d";"e";"e";"e";"e"];;
```

#### Decode a run-length encoded list. (*medium*)

Given a run-length code list generated as specified in the previous
problem, construct its uncompressed version.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let decode list =
>   let rec many acc n x =
>     if n = 0 then acc else many (x :: acc) (n-1) x in
>   let rec aux acc = function
>     | [] -> acc
>     | One x :: t -> aux (x :: acc) t
>     | Many (n,x) :: t -> aux (many acc n x) t  in
>   aux [] (List.rev list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
 decode [Many (4,"a"); One "b"; Many (2,"c"); Many (2,"a"); One "d"; Many (4,"e")];;
```

#### Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution). (*medium*)

Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method
directly. I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the
duplicates, as in problem "[Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists](#Packconsecutiveduplicatesoflistelementsintosublistsmedium)", but only count them. As in problem 
"[Modified run-length encoding](#Modifiedrunlengthencodingeasy)", simplify the result list by replacing the singleton lists (1 X) by X.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let encode list =
>   let rle count x = if count = 0 then One x else Many (count + 1, x) in
>   let rec aux count acc = function
>     | [] -> [] (* Can only be reached if original list is empty *)
>     | [x] -> rle count x :: acc
>     | a :: (b :: _ as t) -> if a = b then aux (count + 1) acc t
>                             else aux 0 (rle count a :: acc) t  in
>   List.rev (aux 0 [] list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
encode ["a";"a";"a";"a";"b";"c";"c";"a";"a";"d";"e";"e";"e";"e"];;
```

#### Duplicate the elements of a list. (*easy*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec duplicate = function
>   | [] -> []
>   | h :: t -> h :: h :: duplicate t;;
> ```

```ocamltop
duplicate ["a";"b";"c";"c";"d"];;
```


#### Replicate the elements of a list a given number of times. (*medium*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let replicate list n =
>   let rec prepend n acc x =
>     if n = 0 then acc else prepend (n-1) (x :: acc) x in
>   let rec aux acc = function
>     | [] -> acc
>     | h :: t -> aux (prepend n acc h) t  in
>   (* This could also be written as:
>      List.fold_left (prepend n) [] (List.rev list) *)
>   aux [] (List.rev list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
replicate ["a";"b";"c"] 3;;
```

#### Drop every N'th element from a list. (*medium*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let drop list n =
>   let rec aux i = function
>     | [] -> []
>     | h :: t -> if i = n then aux 1 t else h :: aux (i+1) t  in
>   aux 1 list;;
> ```

```ocamltop
drop ["a";"b";"c";"d";"e";"f";"g";"h";"i";"j"] 3;;
```

#### Split a list into two parts; the length of the first part is given. (*easy*)

If the length of the first part is longer than the entire list, then the
first part is the list and the second part is empty.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let split list n =
>   let rec aux i acc = function
>     | [] -> List.rev acc, []
>     | h :: t as l -> if i = 0 then List.rev acc, l
>                      else aux (i-1) (h :: acc) t  in
>   aux n [] list
> ```

```ocamltop
split ["a";"b";"c";"d";"e";"f";"g";"h";"i";"j"] 3;;
split ["a";"b";"c";"d"] 5;;
```


#### Extract a slice from a list. (*medium*)

Given two indices, `i` and `k`, the slice is the list containing the
elements between the `i`'th and `k`'th element of the original list
(both limits included). Start counting the elements with 0 (this is the
way the `List` module numbers elements).

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let slice list i k =
>   let rec take n = function
>     | [] -> []
>     | h :: t -> if n = 0 then [] else h :: take (n-1) t
>   in
>   let rec drop n = function
>     | [] -> []
>     | h :: t as l -> if n = 0 then l else drop (n-1) t
>   in
>   take (k - i + 1) (drop i list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
slice ["a";"b";"c";"d";"e";"f";"g";"h";"i";"j"] 2 6;;
```


#### Rotate a list N places to the left. (*medium*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let split list n =
>   let rec aux i acc = function
>     | [] -> List.rev acc, []
>     | h :: t as l -> if i = 0 then List.rev acc, l
>                      else aux (i-1) (h :: acc) t  in
>   aux n [] list
> 
> let rotate list n =
>   let len = List.length list in
>   (* Compute a rotation value between 0 and len-1 *)
>   let n = if len = 0 then 0 else (n mod len + len) mod len in
>   if n = 0 then list
>   else let a, b = split list n in b @ a;;
> ```

```ocamltop
rotate ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"] 3;;
rotate ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"] (-2);;
```


#### Remove the K'th element from a list. (*easy*)

The first element of the list is numbered 0, the second 1,...

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec remove_at n = function
>   | [] -> []
>   | h :: t -> if n = 0 then t else h :: remove_at (n-1) t;;
> ```

```ocamltop
remove_at 1 ["a";"b";"c";"d"];;
```


#### Insert an element at a given position into a list. (*easy*)

Start counting list elements with 0.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec insert_at x n = function
>   | [] -> []
>   | h :: t as l -> if n = 0 then x :: l else h :: insert_at x (n-1) t;;
> ```

```ocamltop
insert_at "alfa" 1 ["a";"b";"c";"d"];;
```


#### Create a list containing all integers within a given range. (*easy*)

If first argument is smaller than second, produce a list in decreasing
order.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let range a b =
>   let rec aux a b =
>     if a > b then [] else a :: aux (a+1) b  in
>   if a > b then List.rev (aux b a) else aux a b;;
> ```

```ocamltop
range 4 9;;
range 9 4;;
```


#### Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a list. (*medium*)

The selected items shall be returned in a list. We use the `Random`
module but do not initialize it with `Random.self_init` for
reproducibility.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec rand_select list n =
>   let rec extract acc n = function
>     | [] -> raise Not_found
>     | h :: t -> if n = 0 then (h, acc @ t) else extract (h::acc) (n-1) t
>   in
>   let extract_rand list len =
>     extract [] (Random.int len) list
>   in
>   let rec aux n acc list len =
>     if n = 0 then acc else
>       let picked, rest = extract_rand list len in
>       aux (n-1) (picked :: acc) rest (len-1)
>   in
>   let len = List.length list in
>   aux (min n len) [] list len;;
> ```

```ocamltop
rand_select ["a";"b";"c";"d";"e";"f";"g";"h"] 3;;
```


#### Lotto: Draw N different random numbers from the set 1..M. (*easy*)

The selected numbers shall be returned in a list.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* [range] and [rand_select] defined in problems above *)
> let lotto_select n m = rand_select (range 1 m) n;;
> ```

```ocamltop
lotto_select 6 49;;
```


#### Generate a random permutation of the elements of a list. (*easy*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec permutation list =
>   let rec extract acc n = function
>     | [] -> raise Not_found
>     | h :: t -> if n = 0 then (h, acc @ t) else extract (h::acc) (n-1) t
>   in
>   let extract_rand list len =
>     extract [] (Random.int len) list
>   in
>   let rec aux acc list len =
>     if len = 0 then acc else
>       let picked, rest = extract_rand list len in
>       aux (picked :: acc) rest (len-1)
>   in
>   aux [] list (List.length list);;
> ```

```ocamltop
permutation ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"];;
```


#### Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N
elements of a list. (*medium*)

In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12
people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K)
denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure mathematicians,
this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the
possibilities in a list.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let extract k list =
>   let rec aux k acc emit = function
>     | [] -> acc
>     | h :: t ->
>       if k = 1 then aux k (emit [h] acc) emit t else
>         let new_emit x = emit (h :: x) in
>         aux k (aux (k-1) acc new_emit t) emit t
>   in
>   let emit x acc = x :: acc in
>   aux k [] emit list;;
> ```

```ocamltop
extract 2 ["a";"b";"c";"d"];;
```

#### Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets. (*medium*)

1. In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint subgroups
of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write a function that generates all the
possibilities and returns them in a list.
2. Generalize the above function in a way that we can specify a list of
group sizes and the function will return a list of groups.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
>   (* This implementation is less streamlined than the one-extraction
>   version, because more work is done on the lists after each
>   transform to prepend the actual items. The end result is cleaner
>   in terms of code, though. *)
> 
>   let group list sizes =
>     let initial = List.map (fun size -> size, []) sizes in
>
>   (* The core of the function. Prepend accepts a list of groups,
>      each with the number of items that should be added, and
>      prepends the item to every group that can support it, thus
>      turning [1,a ; 2,b ; 0,c] into [ [0,x::a ; 2,b ; 0,c ];
>      [1,a ; 1,x::b ; 0,c]; [ 1,a ; 2,b ; 0,c ]]
> 
>      Again, in the prolog language (for which these questions are
>      originally intended), this function is a whole lot simpler.  *)
>   let prepend p list =
>     let emit l acc = l :: acc in
>     let rec aux emit acc = function
>       | [] -> emit [] acc
>       | (n,l) as h :: t ->
>          let acc = if n > 0 then emit ((n-1, p::l) :: t) acc
>                    else acc in
>          aux (fun l acc -> emit (h :: l) acc) acc t
>     in
>     aux emit [] list
>   in
>   let rec aux = function
>     | [] -> [ initial ]
>     | h :: t -> List.concat (List.map (prepend h) (aux t))
>   in
>   let all = aux list in
>   (* Don't forget to eliminate all group sets that have non-full
>      groups *)
>   let complete = List.filter (List.for_all (fun (x,_) -> x = 0)) all in
>   List.map (List.map snd) complete
> ```

```ocamltop
group ["a";"b";"c";"d"] [2;1]
```

#### Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists. (*medium*)

1. We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves.
The objective is to sort the elements of this list according to their
length. E.g. short lists first, longer lists later, or vice versa.

2. Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists
themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of this
list according to their **length frequency**; i.e., in the default,
where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed
first, others with a more frequent length come later.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* We might not be allowed to use built-in List.sort, so here's an
>    eight-line implementation of insertion sort — O(n²) time
>    complexity. *)
> let rec insert cmp e = function
>   | [] -> [e]
>   | h :: t as l -> if cmp e h <= 0 then e :: l else h :: insert cmp e t
> 
> let rec sort cmp = function
>   | [] -> []
>   | h :: t -> insert cmp h (sort cmp t)
> 
> (* Sorting according to length : prepend length, sort, remove length *)
> let length_sort lists =
>   let lists = List.map (fun list -> List.length list, list) lists in
>   let lists = sort (fun a b -> compare (fst a) (fst b)) lists in
>   List.map snd lists
> ;;
> 
> (* Sorting according to length frequency : prepend frequency, sort,
>    remove frequency. Frequencies are extracted by sorting lengths
>    and applying RLE to count occurences of each length (see problem
>    "Run-length encoding of a list.") *)
> let rle list =
>   let rec aux count acc = function
>     | [] -> [] (* Can only be reached if original list is empty *)
>     | [x] -> (x, count + 1) :: acc
>     | a :: (b :: _ as t) ->
>        if a = b then aux (count + 1) acc t

>   let sorted = sort (fun a b -> compare (fst a) (fst b)) by_freq in
>   List.map snd sorted
> ```

```ocamltop
length_sort [ ["a";"b";"c"]; ["d";"e"]; ["f";"g";"h"]; ["d";"e"];
              ["i";"j";"k";"l"]; ["m";"n"]; ["o"] ];;
frequency_sort [ ["a";"b";"c"]; ["d";"e"]; ["f";"g";"h"]; ["d";"e"];
                 ["i";"j";"k";"l"]; ["m";"n"]; ["o"] ];;
```


## Arithmetic

#### Determine whether a given integer number is prime. (*medium*)

SOLUTION

> Recall that `d` divides `n` iff `n mod d = 0`.  This is a naive
> solution.  See the [Sieve of
> Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for a
> more clever one.
> 
> ```ocamltop
> let is_prime n =
>   let n = abs n in
>   let rec is_not_divisor d =
>     d * d > n || (n mod d <> 0 && is_not_divisor (d+1)) in
>   n <> 1 && is_not_divisor 2
> ```

```ocamltop
not(is_prime 1);;
is_prime 7;;
not (is_prime 12)
```

#### Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integer numbers. (*medium*)

Use Euclid's algorithm.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec gcd a b =
>   if b = 0 then a else gcd b (a mod b)
> ```

```ocamltop
gcd 13 27;;
gcd 20536 7826
```

#### Determine whether two positive integer numbers are coprime. (*easy*)

Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* [gcd] is defined in the previous question *)
> let coprime a b = gcd a b = 1
> ```

```ocamltop
coprime 13 27;;
not (coprime 20536 7826)
```


#### Calculate Euler's totient function φ(m). (*medium*)

Euler's so-called totient function φ(m) is defined as the number of
positive integers r (1 ≤ r < m) that are coprime to m. We let φ(1) = 1.

Find out what the value of φ(m) is if m is a prime number.  Euler's
totient function plays an important role in one of the most widely used
public key cryptography methods (RSA). In this exercise you should use
the most primitive method to calculate this function (there are smarter
ways that we shall discuss later).

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* [coprime] is defined in the previous question *)
> let phi n =
>   let rec count_coprime acc d =
>     if d < n then
>       count_coprime (if coprime n d then acc + 1 else acc) (d + 1)
>     else acc
>   in
>   if n = 1 then 1 else count_coprime 0 1
> ```

```ocamltop
phi 10;;
phi 13;;

#### Calculate Euler's totient function φ(m) (improved). (*medium*)

See problem "[Calculate Euler&#39;s totient function φ(m)][totient]" for
the definition of Euler's totient function. If the list of the prime
factors of a number m is known in the form of the previous problem then
the function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: Let
`[(p1, m1); (p2, m2); (p3, m3); ...]` be the list of prime factors
(and their multiplicities) of a given number m. Then φ(m) can be
calculated with the following formula:

φ(m) = (p1 - 1) × p1<sup>m1 - 1</sup> × (p2 - 1) ×
p2<sup>m2 - 1</sup> × (p3 - 1) × p3<sup>m3 - 1</sup> × ⋯

#### Goldbach's conjecture. (*medium*)

Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than
2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It is one of
the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be
correct in the general case. It has been *numerically confirmed* up to
very large numbers. Write a function to find the two prime numbers that
sum up to a given even integer.

## Logic and Codes

Let us define a small "language" for boolean expressions containing
variables:

```ocamltop
type bool_expr =
  | Var of string
  | Not of bool_expr
  | And of bool_expr * bool_expr
  | Or of bool_expr * bool_expr
```

A logical expression in two variables can then be written in prefix
notation.  For example, `(a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∧ b)` is written:

```ocamltop
And(Or(Var "a", Var "b"), And(Var "a", Var "b"))
```

#### Truth tables for logical expressions (2 variables). (*medium*)

Define a function, `table2` which returns the truth table of a given
logical expression in two variables (specified as arguments). The return
value must be a list of triples containing
`(value_of_a, balue_of_b,     value_of_expr)`.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec eval2 a val_a b val_b = function
>   | Var x -> if x = a then val_a
>              else if x = b then val_b
>              else failwith "The expression contains an invalid variable"
>   | Not e -> not(eval2 a val_a b val_b e)
>   | And(e1, e2) -> eval2 a val_a b val_b e1 && eval2 a val_a b val_b e2
>   | Or(e1, e2) -> eval2 a val_a b val_b e1 || eval2 a val_a b val_b e2
> let table2 a b expr =
>   [(true,  true,  eval2 a true  b true  expr);
>    (true,  false, eval2 a true  b false expr);
>    (false, true,  eval2 a false b true  expr);
>    (false, false, eval2 a false b false expr) ]

```ocamltop
table2 "a" "b" (And(Var "a", Or(Var "a", Var "b")));;
```


#### Truth tables for logical expressions. (*medium*)

Generalize the previous problem in such a way that the logical
expression may contain any number of logical variables. Define `table`
in a way that `table variables     expr` returns the truth table for the
expression `expr`, which contains the logical variables enumerated in
`variables`.

#### Gray code. (*medium*)

An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed according
to certain rules. For example,

```text
n = 1: C(1) = ['0','1'].
n = 2: C(2) = ['00','01','11','10'].
n = 3: C(3) = ['000','001','011','010',´110´,´111´,´101´,´100´].
```
Find out the construction rules and write a function with the following
specification: `gray n` returns the `n`-bit Gray code.

#### Huffman code. (*hard*)

First of all, consult a good book on discrete mathematics or algorithms
for a detailed description of Huffman codes (you can start with the
[Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding))!

We suppose a set of symbols with their frequencies, given as a list of
`Fr(S,F)` terms. Example:
`fs = [Fr(a,45); Fr(b,13); Fr(c,12); Fr(d,16); Fr(e,9);       Fr(f,5)]`.
Our objective is to construct a list `Hc(S,C)` terms, where `C` is the
Huffman code word for the symbol `S`. In our example, the result could
be
`hs = [Hc(a,'0'); Hc(b,'101'); Hc(c,'100');       Hc(d,'111'); Hc(e,'1101'); hc(f,'1100')]`
[hc(a,'01'),...etc.]. The task shall be performed by the function
`huffman` defined as follows: `huffman(fs)` returns the Huffman code
table for the frequency table `fs`

## Binary Trees
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/binary-tree.gif" title="Binary Tree"></img>

*A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root element and
two successors, which are binary trees themselves.*

In OCaml, one can define a new type `binary_tree` that carries an
arbitrary value of type `'a` at each node.

```ocamltop
type 'a binary_tree =
  | Empty
  | Node of 'a * 'a binary_tree * 'a binary_tree
```

An example of tree carrying `char` data is:

```ocamltop
let example_tree =
  Node('a', Node('b', Node('d', Empty, Empty), Node('e', Empty, Empty)),
       Node('c', Empty, Node('f', Node('g', Empty, Empty), Empty)))
```

In OCaml, the strict type discipline *guarantees* that, if you get a
value of type `binary_tree`, then it must have been created with the two
constructors `Empty` and `Node`.

#### Construct completely balanced binary trees. (*medium*)

In a completely balanced binary tree, the following property holds for
every node: The number of nodes in its left subtree and the number of
nodes in its right subtree are almost equal, which means their
difference is not greater than one.

Write a function `cbal_tree` to construct completely balanced binary
trees for a given number of nodes. The function should generate all
solutions via backtracking. Put the letter `'x'` as information into all
nodes of the tree.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop

>     add_trees_with t t []
>   else (* n even: n-1 nodes for the left & right subtrees altogether. *)
>     let t1 = cbal_tree (n / 2 - 1) in
>     let t2 = cbal_tree (n / 2) in
>     add_trees_with t1 t2 (add_trees_with t2 t1 [])

cbal_tree 4;;
List.length(cbal_tree 40)

#### Symmetric binary trees. (*medium*)

Let us call a binary tree symmetric if you can draw a vertical line
through the root node and then the right subtree is the mirror image of
the left subtree. Write a function `is_symmetric` to check whether a
given binary tree is symmetric.

Hint: Write a function `is_mirror` first to check whether one tree is
the mirror image of another. We are only interested in the structure,
not in the contents of the nodes.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec is_mirror t1 t2 =
>   match t1, t2 with
>   | Empty, Empty -> true
>   | Node(_, l1, r1), Node(_, l2, r2) ->

#### Binary search trees (dictionaries). (*medium*)

Construct a 
[binary search tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

>      else Node(y, l, insert r x)
> let construct l = List.fold_left insert Empty l;;
> ```

```ocamltop
construct [3;2;5;7;1];;
```

Then use this function to test the solution of the previous problem.

```ocamltop
is_symmetric(construct [5;3;18;1;4;12;21]);;
not(is_symmetric(construct [3;2;5;7;4]))
```


#### Generate-and-test paradigm. (*medium*)

Apply the generate-and-test paradigm to construct all symmetric,
completely balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.

How many such trees are there with 57 nodes? Investigate about how many
solutions there are for a given number of nodes? What if the number is
even? Write an appropriate function.

```ocamltop
List.length (sym_cbal_trees 57);;
List.map (fun n -> n, List.length(sym_cbal_trees n)) (range 10 20)
```


#### Construct height-balanced binary trees. (*medium*)

In a height-balanced binary tree, the following property holds for every
node: The height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree
are almost equal, which means their difference is not greater than one.

Write a function `hbal_tree` to construct height-balanced binary trees
for a given height. The function should generate all solutions via
backtracking. Put the letter `'x'` as information into all nodes of the
tree.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec hbal_tree n =
>   if n = 0 then [Empty]

#### Construct height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes. (*medium*)
<!-- FIXME -->

Consider a height-balanced binary tree of height `h`. What is the
maximum number of nodes it can contain? Clearly, *maxN = 2<sup>`h`</sup>
* 1
*. However, what is the minimum number *minN*? This question is more
difficult. Try to find a recursive statement and turn it into a function
`minNodes` defined as follows: `minNodes h` returns the minimum number
of nodes in a height-balanced binary tree of height `h`.

<!--SOLUTION-->

```ocaml
  (* solution pending *)
```

On the other hand, we might ask: what is the maximum height H a
height-balanced binary tree with N nodes can have? `maxHeight n` returns
the maximum height of a height-balanced binary tree with `n` nodes.

Now, we can attack the main problem: construct all the height-balanced
binary trees with a given nuber of nodes. `hbal_tree_nodes n` returns a
list of all height-balanced binary tree with `n` nodes.

Find out how many height-balanced trees exist for `n = 15`.

```ocamltop
List.length (hbal_tree_nodes 15)
```


#### Count the leaves of a binary tree. (*easy*)

A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a function `count_leaves` to
count them.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec count_leaves = function
>   | Empty -> 0
>   | Node(_, Empty, Empty) -> 1
>   | Node(_, l, r) -> count_leaves l + count_leaves r

```ocamltop
count_leaves Empty;;
count_leaves example_tree;;
```


#### Collect the leaves of a binary tree in a list. (*easy*)

A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a function `leaves` to
collect them in a list.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec leaves = function
>   | Empty -> []
>   | Node(c, Empty, Empty) -> [c]
>   | Node(_, l, r) -> leaves l @ leaves r
> ```

```ocamltop
  leaves Empty;;
  leaves example_tree;;
```


#### Collect the internal nodes of a binary tree in a list. (*easy*)

An internal node of a binary tree has either one or two non-empty
successors. Write a function `internals` to collect them in a list.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec internals = function
>   | Empty | Node(_, Empty, Empty) -> []
>   | Node(c, l, r) -> internals l @ (c :: internals r)
> ```

```ocamltop
internals (Node('a', Empty, Empty));;
internals example_tree;;
```


#### Collect the nodes at a given level in a list. (*easy*)

A node of a binary tree is at level N if the path from the root to the
node has length N-1. The root node is at level 1. Write a function
`at_level t l` to collect all nodes of the tree `t` at level `l` in a
list.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec at_level t l = match t with
>   | Empty -> []
>   | Node(c, left, right) ->
>      if l = 1 then [c]
>      else at_level left (l - 1) @ at_level right (l - 1)
> ```

```ocamltop
at_level example_tree 2;;
at_level example_tree 5;;
```

Using `at_level` it is easy to construct a function `levelorder` which
creates the level-order sequence of the nodes. However, there are more
efficient ways to do that.

#### Construct a complete binary tree. (*medium*)

A *complete* binary tree with height H is defined as follows: The levels
1,2,3,...,H-1 contain the maximum number of nodes (i.e 2<sup>i-1</sup>
at the level i, note that we start counting the levels from 1 at the
root). In level H, which may contain less than the maximum possible
number of nodes, all the nodes are "left-adjusted". This means that in a
levelorder tree traversal all internal nodes come first, the leaves come
second, and empty successors (the nil's which are not really nodes!)
come last.

Particularly, complete binary trees are used as data structures (or
addressing schemes) for heaps.

We can assign an address number to each node in a complete binary tree
by enumerating the nodes in levelorder, starting at the root with
number 1. In doing so, we realize that for every node X with address A
the following property holds: The address of X's left and right
successors are 2*A and 2*A+1, respectively, supposed the successors do
exist. This fact can be used to elegantly construct a complete binary
tree structure. Write a function `is_complete_binary_tree` with the
following specification: `is_complete_binary_tree n t` returns `true`
iff `t` is a complete binary tree with `n` nodes.

<!-- SOLUTION -->

```ocaml
  (* solution pending *)
```


#### Layout a binary tree (1). (*medium*)

As a preparation for drawing the tree, a layout algorithm is required to
determine the position of each node in a rectangular grid. Several
layout methods are conceivable, one of them is shown in the illustration.

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/tree-layout1.gif" title="Binary Tree Grid"></img>

In this layout strategy, the position of a node v is obtained by the
following two rules:

* *x(v)* is equal to the position of the node v in the *inorder*
 sequence;
* *y(v)* is equal to the depth of the node *v* in the tree.

In order to store the position of the nodes, we redefine the OCaml type
representing a node (and its successors) as follows:

```ocamltop
type 'a pos_binary_tree =
  | E (* represents the empty tree *)
  | N of 'a * int * int * 'a pos_binary_tree * 'a pos_binary_tree
```
`N(w,x,y,l,r)` represents a (non-empty) binary tree with root `w`
"positioned" at `(x,y)`, and subtrees `l` and `r`. Write a function
`layout_binary_tree` with the following specification:
`layout_binary_tree t` returns the "positioned" binary tree obtained
from the binary tree `t`.

<!-- SOLUTION -->

```ocaml
  (* solution pending *)
```


#### Layout a binary tree (2). (*medium*)

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/tree-layout2.gif" title="Binary Tree Grid"></img>

An alternative layout method is depicted in this illustration. Find
out the rules and write the corresponding OCaml function.

Hint: On a given level, the horizontal distance between neighbouring
nodes is constant.

```ocaml

#### Layout a binary tree (3). (*hard*)

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/tree-layout3.gif" title="Binary Tree Grid"></img>

Yet another layout strategy is shown in the above illustration. The
method yields a very compact layout while maintaining a certain symmetry
in every node. Find out the rules and write the corresponding
predicate.

Hint: Consider the horizontal distance between a node and its successor
nodes. How tight can you pack together two subtrees to construct the
combined binary tree? This is a difficult problem. Don't give up too
early!

#### A string representation of binary trees. (*medium*)

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/binary-tree.gif" title="Binary Tree"></img>

Somebody represents binary trees as strings of the following type (see
example): `"a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))"`.

* Write an OCaml function which generates this string representation,
 if the tree is given as usual (as `Empty` or `Node(x,l,r)` term).
 Then write a function which does this inverse; i.e. given the string
 representation, construct the tree in the usual form. Finally,
 combine the two predicates in a single function `tree_string` which
 can be used in both directions.
* Write the same predicate `tree_string` using difference lists and a
 single predicate `tree_dlist` which does the conversion between a
 tree and a difference list in both directions.

For simplicity, suppose the information in the nodes is a single letter
and there are no spaces in the string.

<!-- SOLUTION -->

```ocaml
  (* solution pending *)
```


#### Preorder and inorder sequences of binary trees. (*medium*)

We consider binary trees with nodes that are identified by single
lower-case letters, as in the example of the previous problem.

1. Write functions `preorder` and `inorder` that construct the preorder
 and inorder sequence of a given binary tree, respectively. The
 results should be atoms, e.g. 'abdecfg' for the preorder sequence of
 the example in the previous problem.
1. Can you use `preorder` from problem part 1. in the reverse
 direction; i.e. given a preorder sequence, construct a corresponding
 tree? If not, make the necessary arrangements.
1. If both the preorder sequence and the inorder sequence of the nodes
 of a binary tree are given, then the tree is determined
 unambiguously. Write a function `pre_in_tree` that does the job.
1. Solve problems 1. to 3. using difference lists. Cool! Use the
 function `timeit` (defined in problem “[Compare the two methods of
 calculating Euler&#39;s totient function.](#timeit)”) to compare the
 solutions.

#### Dotstring representation of binary trees. (*medium*)

We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by single
lower-case letters, as in the example of problem “[A string
representation of binary trees][tree-string]”. Such a tree can be
represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which dots (.) are
inserted where an empty subtree (nil) is encountered during the tree
traversal. For example, the tree shown in problem “[A string
representation of binary trees][tree-string]” is represented as
'abd..e..c.fg...'. First, try to establish a syntax (BNF or syntax
diagrams) and then write a function `tree_dotstring` which does the
conversion in both directions. Use difference lists.

## Multiway Trees
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/multiway-tree.gif" title="Multiway Tree"></img>

*A multiway tree is composed of a root element and a (possibly empty)
set of successors which are multiway trees themselves. A multiway tree
is never empty. The set of successor trees is sometimes called a
forest.*

To represent multiway trees, we will use the following type which is a
direct translation of the definition:

```ocamltop
type 'a mult_tree = T of 'a * 'a mult_tree list
```

The example tree depicted opposite is therefore represented by the
following OCaml expression:

```ocamltop
T('a', [T('f',[T('g',[])]); T('c',[]); T('b',[T('d',[]); T('e',[])])])
```


#### Count the nodes of a multiway tree. (*easy*)

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec count_nodes (T(_, sub)) =
>   List.fold_left (fun n t -> n + count_nodes t) 1 sub
> ```

```ocamltop
count_nodes (T('a', [T('f',[]) ]))
```


#### Tree construction from a node string. (*medium*)
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/multiway-tree.gif" title="Multiway Tree"></img>

We suppose that the nodes of a multiway tree contain single characters.
In the depth-first order sequence of its nodes, a special character `^`
has been inserted whenever, during the tree traversal, the move is a
backtrack to the previous level.

By this rule, the tree in the figure opposite is represented as:
`afg^^c^bd^e^^^`.

Write functions `string_of_tree : char mult_tree -> string` to construct
the string representing the tree and
`tree_of_string : string -> char mult_tree` to construct the tree when
the string is given.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* We could build the final string by string concatenation but
>    this is expensive due to the number of operations.  We use a
>    buffer instead. *)
> let rec add_string_of_tree buf (T(c, sub)) =
>   Buffer.add_char buf c;
>   List.iter (add_string_of_tree buf) sub;
>   Buffer.add_char buf '^'
> let string_of_tree t =
>   let buf = Buffer.create 128 in
>   add_string_of_tree buf t;
>   Buffer.contents buf;;
> let rec tree_of_substring t s i len =
>   if i >= len || s.[i] = '^' then List.rev t, i + 1
>   else
>     let sub, j = tree_of_substring [] s (i+1) len in
>     tree_of_substring (T(s.[i], sub) ::t) s j len
> let tree_of_string s =
>   match tree_of_substring [] s 0 (String.length s) with
>   | [t], _ -> t
>   | _ -> failwith "tree_of_string"
> ```

```ocamltop
let t = T('a', [T('f',[T('g',[])]); T('c',[]);
          T('b',[T('d',[]); T('e',[])])]);;
string_of_tree t;;
tree_of_string "afg^^c^bd^e^^^";;
```


#### Determine the internal path length of a tree. (*easy*)

We define the internal path length of a multiway tree as the total sum
of the path lengths from the root to all nodes of the tree. By this
definition, the tree `t` in the figure of the previous problem has an
internal path length of 9. Write a function `ipl tree` that returns the
internal path length of `tree`.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec ipl_sub len (T(_, sub)) =
>   (* [len] is the distance of the current node to the root.  Add the
>      distance of all sub-nodes. *)
>   List.fold_left (fun sum t -> sum + ipl_sub (len + 1) t) len sub
> let ipl t = ipl_sub 0 t
> ```

```ocamltop
ipl t
```


#### Construct the bottom-up order sequence of the tree nodes. (*easy*)

Write a function `bottom_up t` which constructs the bottom-up sequence
of the nodes of the multiway tree `t`.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec prepend_bottom_up (T(c, sub)) l =
>   List.fold_right (fun t l -> prepend_bottom_up t l) sub (c :: l)
> let bottom_up t = prepend_bottom_up t []
> ```

```ocamltop
bottom_up (T('a', [T('b', [])]));;
bottom_up t;;
```


#### Lisp-like tree representation. (*medium*)

There is a particular notation for multiway trees in Lisp. The
picture shows how multiway tree structures are represented in Lisp.

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/lisp-like-tree.png" title="Lisp representation of multiway
trees"></img>

Note that in the "lispy" notation a node with successors (children) in
the tree is always the first element in a list, followed by its
children. The "lispy" representation of a multiway tree is a sequence of
atoms and parentheses '(' and ')'. This is very close to the way trees
are represented in OCaml, except that no constructor `T` is used. Write
a function `lispy :       char mult_tree -> string` that returns the
lispy notation of the tree.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let rec add_lispy buf = function
>   | T(c, []) -> Buffer.add_char buf c
>   | T(c, sub) ->
>      Buffer.add_char buf '(';
>      Buffer.add_char buf c;
>      List.iter (fun t -> Buffer.add_char buf ' '; add_lispy buf t) sub;
>      Buffer.add_char buf ')'
> let lispy t =
>   let buf = Buffer.create 128 in
>   add_lispy buf t;
>   Buffer.contents buf
> ```

```ocamltop
lispy (T('a', []));;
lispy (T('a', [T('b', [])]));;
lispy t;;
```

## Graphs
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/graph1.gif" title="A graph"></img>

*A graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges, where each
edge is a pair of different nodes.*

There are several ways to represent graphs in OCaml.

* One method is to list all edges, an edge being a pair of nodes. In
 this form, the graph depicted opposite is represented as the
 following expression:

```ocamltop
['h', 'g';  'k', 'f';  'f', 'b';  'f', 'c';  'c', 'b']
```

We call this **edge-clause form**. Obviously, isolated nodes cannot
be represented.


* Another method is to represent the whole graph as one data object.
 According to the definition of the graph as a pair of two sets
 (nodes and edges), we may use the following OCaml type:

```ocamltop
type 'a graph_term = { nodes : 'a list;  edges : ('a * 'a) list }
```

Then, the above example graph is represented by:

```ocamltop
let example_graph =
  { nodes = ['b'; 'c'; 'd'; 'f'; 'g'; 'h'; 'k'];
    edges = ['h', 'g';  'k', 'f';  'f', 'b';  'f', 'c';  'c', 'b'] }
```

We call this **graph-term form**. Note, that the lists are kept
sorted, they are really sets, without duplicated elements. Each edge
appears only once in the edge list; i.e. an edge from a node x to
another node y is represented as `(x,y)`, the couple `(y,x)` is not
present. The **graph-term form is our default representation.** You
may want to define a similar type using sets instead of lists.

* A third representation method is to associate with each node the set
 of nodes that are adjacent to that node. We call this the
 **adjacency-list form**. In our example:

```ocaml
(* example pending *)
```

* The representations we introduced so far well suited for automated
 processing, but their syntax is not very user-friendly. Typing the
 terms by hand is cumbersome and error-prone. We can define a more
 compact and "human-friendly" notation as follows: A graph (with char
 labelled nodes) is represented by a string of atoms and terms of the
 type X-Y. The atoms stand for isolated nodes, the X-Y terms describe
 edges. If an X appears as an endpoint of an edge, it is
 automatically defined as a node. Our example could be written as:

```ocamltop
"b-c f-c g-h d f-b k-f h-g"
```

We call this the **human-friendly form**. As the example shows, the
list does not have to be sorted and may even contain the same edge
multiple times. Notice the isolated node `d`.


#### Conversions. (*easy*)

Write functions to convert between the different graph representations.
With these functions, all representations are equivalent; i.e. for the
following problems you can always pick freely the most convenient form.
This problem is not particularly difficult, but it's a lot of work to
deal with all the special cases.

<!-- SOLUTION -->

(* example pending *)

#### Path from one node to another one. (*medium*)

Write a function `paths g a b` that returns all acyclic path `p` from
node `a` to node `b ≠ a` in the graph `g`. The function should return
the list of all paths via backtracking.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> (* The datastructures used here are far from the most efficient ones
>    but allow for a straightforward implementation. *)
> (* Returns all neighbors satisfying the condition. *)
> let neighbors g a cond =
>   let edge l (b,c) = if b = a && cond c then c :: l
>                      else if c = a && cond b then b :: l
>                      else l in
>   List.fold_left edge [] g.edges
> let rec list_path g a to_b = match to_b with
>   | [] -> assert false (* [to_b] contains the path to [b]. *)
>   | a' :: _ ->
>      if a' = a then [to_b]
>      else
>        let n = neighbors g a' (fun c -> not(List.mem c to_b)) in
>        List.concat(List.map (fun c -> list_path g a (c :: to_b)) n)
> 
> let paths g a b =
>   assert(a <> b);
>   list_path g a [b]
> ```

```ocamltop
paths example_graph 'f' 'b'
```


#### Cycle from a given node. (*easy*)

Write a functions `cycle g a` that returns a closed path (cycle) `p`
starting at a given node `a` in the graph `g`. The predicate should
return the list of all cycles via backtracking.

SOLUTION

> ```ocamltop
> let cycles g a =
>   let n = neighbors g a (fun _ -> true) in
>   let p = List.concat(List.map (fun c -> list_path g a [c]) n) in
>   List.map (fun p -> p @ [a]) p
> ```

```ocamltop

```


#### Construct all spanning trees. (*medium*)
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/spanning-tree-graph1.gif" title="Spanning tree graph"></img>

Write a function `s_tree g` to construct (by backtracking) all [spanning
trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) of a given graph `g`.
With this predicate, find out how many spanning trees there are for the
graph depicted to the left. The data of this example graph can be found
in the test below. When you have a correct solution for the `s_tree`
function, use it to define two other useful functions: `is_tree graph`
and `is_connected Graph`. Both are five-minutes tasks!

<!-- SOLUTION -->

```ocaml
(* solution pending *);;
```

```ocamltop
let g = { nodes = ['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd'; 'e'; 'f'; 'g'; 'h'];
          edges = [('a', 'b'); ('a', 'd'); ('b', 'c'); ('b', 'e');
                   ('c', 'e'); ('d', 'e'); ('d', 'f'); ('d', 'g');
                   ('e', 'h'); ('f', 'g'); ('g', 'h')] }
```


#### Construct the minimal spanning tree. (*medium*)
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/spanning-tree-graph2.gif" title="Spanning tree graph"></img>

Write a function `ms_tree graph` to construct the minimal spanning tree
of a given labelled graph. A labelled graph will be represented as
follows:

```ocamltop
type ('a, 'b) labeled_graph = { nodes : 'a list;
                                edges : ('a * 'a * 'b) list }
```

(Beware that from now on `nodes` and `edges` mask the previous fields of
the same name.)

Hint: Use the [algorithm of Prim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm). 
A small modification of the solution of P83 does the trick. The data of the
example graph to the right can be found below.

		           ('b', 'e', 4); ('c', 'e', 6); ('d', 'e', 7);
				   ('d', 'f', 4); ('d', 'g', 3); ('e', 'h', 5);
				   ('f', 'g', 4); ('g', 'h', 1)] }
```


#### Graph isomorphism. (*medium*)

Two graphs G1(N1,E1) and G2(N2,E2) are isomorphic if there is a
bijection f: N1 → N2 such that for any nodes X,Y of N1, X and Y are
adjacent if and only if f(X) and f(Y) are adjacent.

Write a function that determines whether two graphs are isomorphic.

## Miscellaneous Problems
<br />
#### Eight queens problem. (*medium*)

This is a classical problem in computer science. The objective is to
place eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens are attacking
each other; i.e., no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or
on the same diagonal.

Hint: Represent the positions of the queens as a list of numbers 1..N.
Example: `[4;2;7;3;6;8;5;1]` means that the queen in the first column is
in row 4, the queen in the second column is in row 2, etc. Use the
generate-and-test paradigm.

#### Knight's tour. (*medium*)

Another famous problem is this one: How can a knight jump on an N×N
chessboard in such a way that it visits every square exactly once?

Hints: Represent the squares by pairs of their coordinates `(x,y)`,
where both `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and N. Define the function
`jump n       (x,y)` that returns all coordinates `(u,v)` to which a
knight can jump from `(x,y)` to on a `n`×`n` chessboard. And finally,
represent the solution of our problem as a list knight positions (the
knight's tour).

#### Von Koch's conjecture. (*hard*)

Several years ago I met a mathematician who was intrigued by a problem
for which he didn't know a solution. His name was Von Koch, and I don't
know whether the problem has been solved since.

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/von-koch1.gif" title="Tree numbering"></img>

Anyway, the puzzle goes like this: Given a tree with N nodes (and hence
N-1 edges). Find a way to enumerate the nodes from 1 to N and,
accordingly, the edges from 1 to N-1 in such a way, that for each edge K
the difference of its node numbers equals to K. The conjecture is that
this is always possible.

For small trees the problem is easy to solve by hand. However, for
larger trees, and 14 is already very large, it is extremely difficult to
find a solution. And remember, we don't know for sure whether there is
always a solution!

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="/img/von-koch2.gif" title="Larger tree"></img>

#### An arithmetic puzzle. (*hard*)

Given a list of integer numbers, find a correct way of inserting
arithmetic signs (operators) such that the result is a correct equation.
Example: With the list of numbers `[2;3;5;7;11]` we can form the
equations 2-3+5+7 = 11 or 2 = (3*5+7)/11 (and ten others!).

#### English number words. (*medium*)

On financial documents, like cheques, numbers must sometimes be written
in full words. Example: 175 must be written as one-seven-five. Write a

In a certain programming language (Ada) identifiers are defined by the
syntax diagram (railroad chart) opposite. Transform the syntax diagram
into a system of syntax diagrams which do not contain loops; i.e. which
are purely recursive. Using these modified diagrams, write a function
`identifier : string -> bool` that can check whether or not a given
string is a legal identifier.

Every spot in the puzzle belongs to a (horizontal) row and a (vertical)
column, as well as to one single 3x3 square (which we call "square" for
short). At the beginning, some of the spots carry a single-digit number
between 1 and 9. The problem is to fill the missing spots with digits in
such a way that every number between 1 and 9 appears exactly once in
each row, in each column, and in each square.

#### Nonograms. (*hard*)

Around 1994, a certain kind of puzzles was very popular in England. The
"Sunday Telegraph" newspaper wrote: "Nonograms are puzzles from Japan
and are currently published each week only in The Sunday Telegraph.
Simply use your logic and skill to complete the grid and reveal a
picture or diagram." As an OCaml programmer, you are in a better
situation: you can have your computer do the work!

The puzzle goes like this: Essentially, each row and column of a
rectangular bitmap is annotated with the respective lengths of its
distinct strings of occupied cells. The person who solves the puzzle
must complete the bitmap given only these lengths.

```text

          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2 2       |_|_|X|X|_|_|X|X| 2 2
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 6         |_|_|X|X|X|X|X|X| 6
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 1 5       |X|_|X|X|X|X|X|_| 1 5
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 6         |X|X|X|X|X|X|_|_| 6

           2 1 5 1                     2 1 5 1
```

For the example above, the problem can be stated as the two lists
`[[3];[2;1];[3;2];[2;2];[6];[1;5];[6];[1];[2]]` and
`[[1;2];[3;1];[1;5];[7;1];[5];[3];[4];[3]]` which give the "solid"
lengths of the rows and columns, top-to-bottom and left-to-right,
respectively. Published puzzles are larger than this example, e.g.
25×20, and apparently always have unique solutions.

#### Crossword puzzle. (*hard*)

Given an empty (or almost empty) framework of a crossword puzzle and a
set of words. The problem is to place the words into the framework.

The particular crossword puzzle is specified in a text file which first
lists the words (one word per line) in an arbitrary order. Then, after
an empty line, the crossword framework is defined. In this framework
specification, an empty character location is represented by a dot (.).
In order to make the solution easier, character locations can also
contain predefined character values. The puzzle above is defined in the
file
[p7_09a.dat](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/7/solutions-7/p7_09a.dat?attredirects=0&d=1),
other examples are
[p7_09b.dat](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/7/solutions-7/p7_09b.dat?attredirects=0&d=1)
and
[p7_09d.dat](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/7/solutions-7/p7_09d.dat?attredirects=0&d=1).
There is also an example of a puzzle
([p7_09c.dat](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/7/solutions-7/p7_09c.dat?attredirects=0&d=1))
which does not have a solution.

Words are strings (character lists) of at least two characters. A
horizontal or vertical sequence of character places in the crossword
puzzle framework is called a site. Our problem is to find a compatible
way of placing words onto sites.

**Hints:**

1. The problem is not easy. You will need some time to thoroughly
 understand it. So, don't give up too early! And remember that the
 objective is a clean solution, not just a quick-and-dirty hack!
1. For efficiency reasons it is important, at least for larger puzzles,
 to sort the words and the sites in a particular order.
