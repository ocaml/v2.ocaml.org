# Camlp4 3.10

**Deprecation Warning:** this tutorial describes technology that is considered obsolete. It's been replaced by [extensions points and ppx rewriters](/releases/{{! get LATEST_OCAML_VERSION_MAIN !}}/htmlman/extn.html#sec243)

**Camlp4**, the OCaml "pre-processor pretty printer" is an advanced
macro system which allows complex abstract syntax tree transformations
on ocaml programs, and on other recursive decent grammars.

**Warning** this page contains advanced material.

Camlp4 underwent a major revision between the version included in ocaml
3.09 and 3.10. The supplied documentation as of this pages' creation is
very small. This page is experimental and user supported content.

## External Documents
The semi-official documentation:
[Camlp4 Wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4/wiki)

The ocaml beta announcement:
[camlp4-changes](http://nicolaspouillard.fr/camlp4-changes.html)

## The examples
An example written for Camlp4 3.10:

* [Camlp4 3.10/Foreach
 Tutorial](foreach_tutorial.html "Camlp4 3.10/Foreach Tutorial")

These examples are from the camlp4 beta announcement:

* [Camlp4
 3.10/dynamic_old_syntax.ml](dynamic_old_syntax.html "Camlp4 3.10/dynamic_old_syntax.ml")
* [Camlp4
 3.10/static_old_syntax.ml](static_old_syntax.html "Camlp4 3.10/static_old_syntax.ml")
* [Camlp4
 3.10/quick_non_extensible_example.ml](quick_non_extensible_example.html "Camlp4 3.10/quick_non_extensible_example.ml")
* [Camlp4
 3.10/dynamic_functor_example.ml](dynamic_functor_example.html "Camlp4 3.10/dynamic_functor_example.ml")
* [Camlp4
 3.10/static_functor_example.ml](static_functor_example.html "Camlp4 3.10/static_functor_example.ml")

This is a translation of M. Jambon's json_static to Camlp4 3.10 by N.
Poulliard.

The patch:

[pa_json_static.patch](http://nicolaspouillard.fr/pub/camlp4/rosetta/pa_json_static/pa_json_static.patch)

The new version (compiles with camlp4orf):

[pa_json_static.ml](http://nicolaspouillard.fr/pub/camlp4/rosetta/pa_json_static/pa_json_static.ml)


## The command line
In the beta announcement, there was mention of new binaries camlp4xxx
that come preloaded with selections of new and old syntaxes

New commands:

* **camlp4orf**: camlp4o + Grammar, macro and revised quotation
 syntaxes.
* **camlp4oof**: camlp4o + Grammar, macro and the same syntax for
 quotations.
* **camlp4rf**: camlp4r + Grammar, macro and the same syntax for
 quotations.

It is not necessary to use a `.cma` file to create a regular camlp4
extension. The `.cmi` libraries are for creating standalone executables.
Only the `.cmi` files from the include path are needed.

So as an example:

```
$ ocamlc -I +camlp4 -pp camlp4orf -c dynamic_functor_example3.ml
```
## The .cma files
From N. Poulliard
[http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2007/04/47c5c935136351afaefee6a0aa9cc506.en.html](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2007/04/47c5c935136351afaefee6a0aa9cc506.en.html)

There is a list of libraries provided with camlp4:

- `camlp4{o,of,orf,r,rf}.cma` are toplevel libs there are only made to be
  loaded in the OCaml [interactive toplevel](../basics.html).

- `camlp4lib.cma` contains the Camlp4 module which holds the camlp4 kernel.

- `camlp4fullilb.cma` contains modules of camlp4lib.cma plus all parsers and
   filters.
