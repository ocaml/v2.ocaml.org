# Introduction to Gtk

If you intend to try the code in this tutorial in the
[interactive toplevel](basics.html), you
must first issue (assuming you have installed `lablgtk` using
[opam](../../docs/install.html)):

```ocamltop
Topdirs.dir_directory (Sys.getenv "OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH");;
#use "topfind";;
#require "lablgtk2";;
```

## Lablgtk and writing Gtk applications

[Gtk+](http://www.gtk.org/) is a toolkit for
writing graphical applications, and
[lablgtk](https://github.com/garrigue/lablgtk)
is the OCaml interface for Gtk. Gtk and lablgtk are available for Unix
and Windows platforms.

Lablgtk makes ambitious use of advanced features of the OCaml type
system. Make sure you're familiar with labelled and optional arguments
and polymorphic variants ([labels](labels.html "labels")) or you won't
have any idea what's going on in this chapter. As it is, even the author
of this tutorial finds ploughing through the lablgtk source code pretty
hard work!

###  Simple lablgtk program
Actually, not so simple. This program has a menu with a "quit" option,
and a button in the main area which you can press:

```ocaml
open GMain
open GdkKeysyms

let locale = GtkMain.Main.init ()

let main () =
  let window = GWindow.window ~width:320 ~height:240
                              ~title:"Simple lablgtk program" () in
  let vbox = GPack.vbox ~packing:window#add () in
  window#connect#destroy ~callback:Main.quit;

  (* Menu bar *)
  let menubar = GMenu.menu_bar ~packing:vbox#pack () in
  let factory = new GMenu.factory menubar in
  let accel_group = factory#accel_group in
  let file_menu = factory#add_submenu "File" in

  (* File menu *)
  let factory = new GMenu.factory file_menu ~accel_group in
  factory#add_item "Quit" ~key:_Q ~callback: Main.quit;

  (* Button *)
  let button = GButton.button ~label:"Push me!"
                              ~packing:vbox#add () in
  button#connect#clicked ~callback: (fun () -> prerr_endline "Ouch!");

  (* Display the windows and enter Gtk+ main loop *)
  window#add_accel_group accel_group;
  window#show ();
  Main.main ()

let () = main ()
```

Save this to a file `simple.ml` and compile it like this:

```shell
ocamlc -g -I path/to/lablgtk lablgtk.cma gtkInit.cmo simple.ml -o simple
```

where you have to replace `path/to/lablgtk` by the actual path where
`lablgtk.cmi`, `lablgtk.cma`,... are.  If you use *findlib*
(recommended), you can use the following command:

```shell
ocamlfind ocamlc -g -package lablgtk2 -linkpkg simple.ml -o simple
```

This is what you should see when you run it:

![Simple lablgtk program](/img/simplee29b.gif "")

Let's analyse the program line by line to see what's going on.

```ocaml
open GMain
open GdkKeysyms
```
`GMain` provides useful functions like the Gtk main loop, so I find it a
good idea to always open this module. `GdkKeysyms` provides some key
definitions, in this case `_Q` for the Ctrl + Q key combination.

```ocaml
let window = GWindow.window ~width:320 ~height:240
                            ~title:"Simple lablgtk program" () in
let vbox = GPack.vbox ~packing:window#add () in
window#connect#destroy ~callback:Main.quit;
```
Firstly we create the toplevel window. Every Gtk program needs at least
one. Notice three things: firstly `GWindow.window` is actually a helper
function which creates a `window` object for you. For various reasons
which we'll discuss in the intensive section at the end of this chapter,
you shouldn't create lablgtk objects using `new classname arguments...`,
but instead use one of these helper functions. The helper functions are
often named the same as the class which they create. Secondly lablgtk
makes extensive use of the `~label` (labelled and optional arguments).
You'll get used to this quickly. Thirdly see the apparently useless `()`
(unit) argument to `GWindow.window`. It's actually not useless, but the
only way for OCaml to tell the difference between a partial and full
function application in the presence of optional arguments.

A `vbox` is a vertical layout widget. It's a container which contains
other widgets but isn't normally visible by itself. The `~packing`
argument looks odd (indeed it is). It's just a shorthand way of writing:

```ocaml
let vbox = GPack.vbox () in
window#add vbox;
```
The two forms are, as far as I can tell, identical. The first way is a
bit shorter.

`window#connect#destroy ~callback:Main.quit;` is an example of
connecting a *signal* to a function. In this case the `destroy` signal,
received by the window when someone presses the "X" in the corner, will
cause a call to `Main.quit ()` (note extra unit arg).

Creating the menubar and File -\> Quit button is straightforward enough.
Notice the `accel_group` object which is used to keep track of
accelerator buttons. The `menubar` is packed first into the `vbox`:

```ocaml
(* Menu bar *)
let menubar = GMenu.menu_bar ~packing:vbox#pack () in
let factory = new GMenu.factory menubar in
let accel_group = factory#accel_group in
let file_menu = factory#add_submenu "File" in

(* File menu *)
let factory = new GMenu.factory file_menu ~accel_group in
factory#add_item "Quit" ~key:_Q ~callback: Main.quit;
```

Next up we create the button and pack it in the `vbox`. Notice the
`clicked` signal which is connected to an anonymous function:

```ocaml
(* Button *)
let button = GButton.button ~label:"Push me!"
                            ~packing:vbox#add () in
button#connect#clicked ~callback: (fun () -> prerr_endline "Ouch!");
```
This line just causes the accelerator keys (eg. Ctrl Q) to work:

```ocaml
window#add_accel_group accel_group;
```
Finally two lines which are essential. All Gtk widgets must be "shown"
before they will appear, by calling the `#show` method. However lablgtk,
by default, automatically shows all widgets *except* toplevel windows.
Thus we need to call `window#show ()` explicitly. `Main.main ()` is the
Gtk main loop - the bit which runs and handles events. Gtk is event
driven so everything else happens in a callback as a result of some
signal received.

```ocaml
window#show ();
Main.main ()
```

##  Gtk tutorial

Read [this Gtk tutorial](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/stable/)
to find out more about Gtk. Lablgtk contains a pretty complete mapping
of the Gtk+ API.

###  Graph widget
Now we're going to get a little bit more adventurous and write our own
widget. This is going to be a simple graph, with a scrollbar at the
bottom allowing you to scroll left and right through the data. The graph
itself is going to be drawn on a Gtk drawing area widget. The Gtk
drawing area is very simple, just an empty space in which you can
execute your own drawing commands to draw lines, rectangles, text and so
on.

Before starting we need to think about the overall structure of our
graph widget. I'm going to have it be a vbox, with the drawing area in
the top part, and the scrollbar in the bottom part. This is the overall
structure of our class:

```ocaml
class graph font ?width ?height ?packing ?show array =
  (* The initialization code will go here. *)

  object (self)
    inherit widget vbox#as_widget

    initializer
      (* Further initialization will go here. *)

    (* Methods will go here. *)
  end
```
To create a widget you will do:

```ocaml
let graph = new graph font array
```

The `inherit widget vbox#as_widget` is interesting. You'll have to read
the section below entited *Structure of lablgtk* to understand it fully,
but basically it causes a graph to be a subclass of widget.

Let's have a look at the initialization code in more detail.

```ocaml
class graph font ?width ?height ?packing ?show array =
  (* Constants. *)
  let page_size = 10 in            (* Number of bars on "page". *)
  let max_y = 10 in                (* Maximum on Y scale. *)

  (* Number of data points. *)
  let array_size = Array.length array in

  (* Create the containing vbox. *)
  let vbox = GPack.vbox ?width ?height ?packing ?show () in

  (* Create the drawing area. *)
  let da = GMisc.drawing_area ~packing:vbox#add () in
  let drawable = lazy (new GDraw.drawable da#misc#window) in

  (* Create the scrollbar. *)
  let adjustment =
    GData.adjustment
      ~lower:0. ~upper:(float_of_int (array_size-1))
      ~step_incr:1. ~page_incr:(float_of_int page_size) () in
  let scrollbar =
    GRange.scrollbar `HORIZONTAL ~adjustment ~packing:vbox#pack () in

  object (self)
    inherit widget vbox#as_widget

    initializer
      ignore(da#event#connect#expose
               ~callback:(fun _ -> self#repaint (); false));
      ignore(adjustment#connect#value_changed
               ~callback:(fun _ -> self#repaint ()))

    (* Methods will go here. *)

    method private repaint () =
      (* Repaint the widget. See below. *)
  end
```

The let-bindings before the start of `object` define constants such as
`page_size`, but also create the Gtk objects like `vbox`, drawing area,
`scrollbar` and `adjustment`.  An adjustment is an abstract object which
records the position of a scrollbar. Notice how in the `initializer` we
attach a signal to the adjustment so that when the scrollbar moves (i.e.,
adjustment changes) we repaint the whole widget.  The private `repaint`
method is where the action is, as it were. That method will actually be
responsible for drawing the graph, axes, title and so on.

We'll see that in just a moment, but let's concentrate on the simpler
methods of the object first:

```ocaml
object (self)
  inherit widget vbox#as_widget

  initializer (* code concealed, see above *)

  (* The title of the graph. *)
  val mutable title = "no title"
  method set_title t = title <- t
  method title = title

  (* ... *)
end
```

The object is going to contain a mutable member, the title, and two
methods to `set_title` and get `title`.

Now we come to the repaint method, which is the guts of the widget. This
draws the graph in the drawing area:

```ocaml
(* Repaint the widget. *)
method private repaint () =
  let drawable = Lazy.force drawable in
  let (width, height) = drawable#size in
  drawable#set_background `WHITE;
  drawable#set_foreground `WHITE;
  drawable#rectangle ~x:0 ~y:0 ~width ~height ~filled:true ();
  drawable#set_foreground `BLACK;

  (* Draw the title. *)
  draw_text drawable font `Centre (width/2, 20) title;

  (* Draw the axes. *)
  drawable#line ~x:40 ~y:(height-40) ~x:(width-40) ~y:(height-40);
  drawable#line ~x:40 ~y:(height-40) ~x:40 ~y:40;

  (* Which part of the data to display? first .. first+page_size-1 *)
  let first_bar = int_of_float adjustment#value in
  let data = Array.sub array first_bar page_size in
  let bar_width = (width - 80) / page_size in

  (* Compute function mapping graph (x, y) to screen coordinates. *)
  let map (x,y) =
    (40 + x * bar_width, height-40 - y * (height-80) / max_y)  in

  (* Draw the axes scales. *)
  draw_text drawable font `Right (40, height-40) "0";
  draw_text drawable font `Right (40, 40) (string_of_int max_y);
  for i = 0 to page_size-1 do
    let x = 40 + i * bar_width + bar_width/2 in
    let y = height-35 in
    let v = first_bar + i in
    draw_text drawable font `Centre (x, y) (string_of_int v)
  done;

  (* Draw the data. *)
  for i = 0 to page_size-1 do
    let (ll_x,ll_y) = map (i, data.(i)) in
    let (tr_x,tr_y) = map (i+1, 0) in
    draw_rectangle drawable "red" (ll_x, ll_y) (tr_x, tr_y)
  done
```

Apart from the calculation of screen coordinates from graph coordinates,
the `repaint` method is essentially very simple. The Gtk drawing area
contains a `drawable` object, and we use methods on this object such as
`drawable#line` plus some helper functions which I haven't reproduced
here to draw in the drawing area. It's really just a matter of
calculating what to draw, where. Notice how we freely access
let-bindings made before `object (self)`, eg. `page_size`, `drawable`,
`adjustment`. These let-bindings are available in any method in the
object.

The complete code for the graph is available in
[graph.ml](graph.ml) and [test.ml](test.ml).
Compile it using:

```ocaml
ocamlfind ocamlc -g -package lablgtk2 -linkpkg graph.ml test.ml -o graphtest
```
Here is a screenshot:

###  Structure of lablgtk
The lablgtk library has two layers, which I'm going to call the *module
layer* and the *object-oriented layer* (plus some ancillary library
modules which we'll also talk about). The layers are arranged like this
in relation to your code:

<!-- FIXME: was the table well ported? -->
Your code and the Gtk+ library (or DLL on Windows)
- Object-oriented layer (eg. `gButton.ml`)
- Module layer (eg. `gtkButton.ml`, depends on `ml_gtkbutton.c`)


In theory you only need to interact with the object-oriented layer, and
the theory is indeed true for trivial programs. However for practical
purposes you will need to understand how the library is built up from
these layers (and why).

####  Gtk objects
We'll start with the peculiarities of Gtk itself. This library is
written in C and uses macros and "clever" hacks to (a) present an OO-ish
interface and (b) perform simple garbage collection through reference
counting. Part of the reason why lablgtk uses quite a complex model is
to cater for the implementation of Gtk itself.

All "objects" in the Gtk library (I'll call them objects, but in reality
they're C `struct`s) are "derived" from `GtkObject`. This means that an
object such as a button contains within its `struct` a
`struct _GtkObject`. This "base class" contains, amongst other things, a
reference count which is used to provide simple garbage collection.

Of course, the above is all in the context of a C library for C
programmers. OCaml has other mechanisms for OO and contains an advanced
garbage collector. How does lablgtk unify the two?

Lablgtk starts with this type definition (in module `Gtk`):

```ocaml
type 'a obj
```
On the face of it, this is a *very* strange type definition. It defines
a polymorphic type called `obj` (polymorphic because you can create,
say, `int obj`, etc.). But it doesn't actually define a way of creating
these objects! [Recall that a normal type definition might be something
like this:

```ocaml
type 'a obj = Something of 'a
```
which gives you a very definite way to create, say, an `int obj`:

```ocaml
Something 1
```
But our strange, bare definition just says:

```ocaml
type 'a obj;;
```
How do we create objects of this type? The answer is that we don't.
Instances of type `'a obj` are `GtkObject` structures (actually, more
likely they are "subclasses" of `GtkObject`), and they are created by
the C library. What precisely happens is that the C functions in the
Gtk+ library are wrapped up by C functions which are called from OCaml.
These functions look like this:

```C
CAMLprim value
ml_gtk_toggle_button_new (value unit)
{
  return Val_GtkObject_sink ((GtkObject *) gtk_toggle_button_new ());
}
```
`Val_GtkObject_sink` is a very complex little function which wraps up
the `GtkObject` returned from the Gtk+ library function
`gtk_toggle_button_new ()` in something that OCaml's garbage collector
can understand. The same function also deals with Gtk's reference
counting.

```C
static void ml_final_GtkObject_sink (value val) {
  if (Field(val,1))
    gtk_object_unref ((GtkObject*)Field(val,1));
}

value Val_GtkObject_sink (GtkObject *p) {
  value ret;
  if (!p) ml_raise_null_pointer ();
  ret = alloc_final (2, ml_final_GtkObject_sink, 20, 1000);
  initialize (&Field(ret,1), (value) p);
  gtk_object_ref_and_sink(p);
  return ret;
}
```

OCaml code calls `ml_gtk_toggle_button_new` directly to create objects
of type `'a obj`. Module `GtkButton` is in lablgtk's module layer and it
contains an inner module called `GtkButton.ToggleButton` containing a
function defined as:

```ocaml
module ToggleButton = struct
  include GtkButtonProps.ToggleButton
  let create_check pl : toggle_button obj = Object.make "GtkCheckButton" pl
  external toggled : [>`toggle] obj -> unit
      = "ml_gtk_toggle_button_toggled"
end
```
You can call these functions directly to see what they return:

```ocamltop
GtkButton.ToggleButton.create;;
GtkButton.ToggleButton.make_params;;
```
Notice the return type: `toggle_button obj` (ie. a definite instance of
the polymorphic type `'a obj`). What is `toggle_button`? It's a type
(think `'a list` vs. `int list`) defined like this (in module `Gtk`):

```ocaml
type widget = [`base|`widget]
type container = [widget|`container]
type button = [container|`button]
type toggle_button = [button|`toggle]
```
Hence the full type written out is:

```ocaml
type toggle_button = [`base|`widget|`container|`button|`toggle]
```
(These are [polymorphic variants](labels.html#Morevariantspolymorphicvariants)).

If you check the Gtk class hierarchy you'll see that the list of
variants closely (but not exactly) matches the classes. A Gtk toggle
button is-a Gtk button, Gtk container is-a Gtk widget, etc.

####  Object-oriented layer
Now let's look at the object-oriented layer interface to the toggle
button, so we can see how `'a obj` comes into play. The `GButton` module
defines a class for toggle buttons, but unusually you don't directly
create instances of this class using `new toggle_button` (or similar).
Instead a function is provided which generates instances for you. Here
it is, simplified somewhat:

```ocaml
let toggle_button ?label ?show () =
  Button.make_params [] ?label ~cont:(
  ToggleButton.make_params ~cont:(
  pack_return (fun p -> new toggle_button (ToggleButton.create p))))
```
The class created by `new toggle_button` is like this
(simplified):

```ocaml
class toggle_button w = object
  inherit button w
  method connect = new toggle_button_signals obj
  method active = ToggleButton.get_active obj
  method set_active = ToggleButton.set_active obj
  method set_draw_indicator = ToggleButton.set_mode obj
end
```
The base class for all objects is `GObj.gtkobj` defined as:

```ocaml
class gtkobj w = object
  val obj = w
  method destroy () = Object.destroy w
  method get_id = Object.get_id w
end
```
So all classes, including `toggle_button`, have access to their
underlying object (the `GtkObject` allocated in C) through the `obj`
member, and have `#destroy` and `#get_id` methods. All classes derived
from `widget` have a public `#as_widget` method which returns the
underlying object (sadly there is no equivalent for `gtkobj`, although
this doesn't matter so much since almost all interesting classes are
widgets).

Let's try the OO interface for toggle buttons:

```ocamltop
(* Call the toggle_button function.  Note: returns object from
   toggle_button class*)
let b = GButton.toggle_button ~label:"Push me!" ();;
b#as_widget
  (* note: returns a widget obj == [`base|`widget] obj *);;
```

####  Downcasts
Gtk is dynamically typed, and this means you can
*downcast*, for example, a widget into a toggle button. Gtk
requires downcasting in some instances: for example you can pack widgets
into containers, but if you try and retrieve them out of the container,
all you get is a list of widgets. The original type of the widgets is
lost. Assuming you know that a widget is really, say, a button, then Gtk
requires you to downcast the widget to a button in order to use the
button-like features.

Such an operation is normally illegal in OCaml because OCaml is strongly
typed at compile time and downcasting is unsafe. The widget might or
might not actually be a toggle button. Lablgtk allows downcasting, and
provides another mechanism for casting which avoids the explicit
downcast. Whichever way you do it, you may get a runtime exception if
you cast to the wrong type.

The simplest downcast is just to unwrap the `'a obj` (`GtkObject`) from
one class and wrap it in another class. Here we take the children out of
a table widget, which we happen to know are actually all vboxes, unwrap
each one from the `widget` class and rewrap in a `GPack.box` class.
(Example due to Jacques Garrigue.)

```ocaml
let vbox_of_widget widget =
  let obj = GtkPack.Box.cast widget#as_widget in
  new GPack.box obj

let vboxes = List.iter vbox_of_widget table#children
```

The terminology might be a little bit confusing here because the
`#as_widget` method returns the internal `GtkObject` of type `'a obj`.

`GtkPack.Box.cast` does the actual unsafe downcast. Downcasts can always
fail at runtime, and in the case above the `Cannot_cast` exception could
be thrown. You should be prepared to deal with this - unfortunately it's
a program bug which cannot be picked up at compile time.

The other method for doing this avoids the explicit downcast, but can
still throw an exception indicating a program bug at runtime. The
strategy here is to remember what objects we put into the container
separately, and when we take them out try to match them up. We use the
`GUtil.memo` class for this:

```ocaml
class ['a] memo () = object
  constraint 'a = #widget
  val tbl = Hashtbl.create 7
  method add (obj : 'a) =
    Hashtbl.add tbl obj#get_id obj
  method find (obj : widget) = Hashtbl.find tbl obj#get_id
  method remove (obj : widget) = Hashtbl.remove tbl obj#get_id
end
```
(The constraint essentially says that `'a` must be a widget, or some
subclass of widget).

Here is an example of using a memo. First we will create a top-level
window, a container (vbox) to go inside this, and a button:

```ocamltop
let w = GWindow.window ();;
let c = GPack.vbox ~packing:w#add ();;
let b = GButton.button ~label:"Push me!" ();;
```
Before we pack the button into the container, let's create a memo to
remember the real object. Notice how the type of the memo is refined as
soon as the button is added:

```ocamltop
let m = new GUtil.memo ();;
m#add b;;
m;;
```
Now we can add the button to the container, remembering to upcast it to
a widget first of course:

```ocamltop
c#add (b :> GObj.widget);;
```
The method `#children` returns a list of widgets. Not much use to us:

```ocamltop
c#children;;
```
But we can use our memo to map these widgets to the original button
objects:

```ocamltop
List.map (fun w -> m#find w) c#children;;
```
Remember that this is still dynamic casting, and so unsafe. In this case
the memo will throw a `Not_found` exception if the widget cannot be
mapped:

```ocamltop
let b2 = GButton.button ~label:"Don't push me!" ();;
c#add (b2 :> GObj.widget);;
List.map (fun w -> m#find w) c#children;;
```

###  Structure of lablgtk — summary

* `GtkObject`s allocated by the C library are wrapped up in opaque
 `'a obj` abstract types.
* The module layer is flat (not OO) but uses polymorphic variants to
 simulate a class hierarchy.
* The module layer handles Gtk's reference counting for you
 transparently.
* Classes in the OO layer store the opaque `GtkObject` in a member
 called `obj`, and perform operations through the module layer,
 usually passing `obj` as the first parameter.
* Helper functions are provided to create instances of classes.
* Lablgtk provides two ways to perform downcasting, but this doesn't
 change the fact that downcasting is unsafe and can throw exceptions
 at runtime.
