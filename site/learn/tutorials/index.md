# OCaml tutorials

####  Your Help is Needed
Many of the tutorials below need updating and tutorials on many new
topics are needed. Please contribute by visiting this project's repo on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org); you may use the issue
tracker there to request or offer new tutorials. Thanks!

###  Learn by Doing

* [Try OCaml Online](http://try.ocamlpro.com/) (by OCamlPro) allows
 you to immediately start learning OCaml in your browser, without
 installing it. Compiled as a single Javascript page, it gives you
 the full power of OCaml, even when your are disconnected from the
 network.
* [PLEAC-OCaml](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_ocaml/) provides
 OCaml solutions to the complete set of problems originally posed in
 the very successful Perl Cookbook. OCaml is one of only 3 languages
 for which the full set of solutions has been provided.
* [Rosetta](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:OCaml) is a
 programming chrestomathy site. It provides solutions to the same
 task in many languages. Currently there are few tasks with OCaml
 solutions provided, but perhaps you would like to add new solutions.

###  Tutorials on OCaml

* [The OCaml System](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/) (by
 Inria) is the official user's manual. The first part provides an
 introduction to the core language, objects and classes, and modules.
 Previous versions are [here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/).
* [How to wrap C functions to
  OCaml](http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/ocaml-wrapping-c.html)
  (by Florent Monnier) explains in an understandable way how to write C
  stubs to call C functions from OCaml and back. It features a lot of
  examples.
* [OCaml for scientific
 computation](http://www.soton.ac.uk/~fangohr/software/ocamltutorial/)
 (by Thomas Fiscbacher), covers a broad sample of OCaml, from the
 basics to the C api.
* [A Concise Introduction to
 OCaml](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~dmatusze/resources/ocaml/ocaml.html)
 (by David Matuszek) gives a concise, yet broad, overview of the
 language and the standard library. It is rather old but most of what
 it says remains valid.

###  WikiBooks on OCaml

* [fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/OCaml](http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/OCaml)
 (in French):
 Introduction on functional programming using OCaml.
* [fr.wikiversity.org/wiki/Premiers_pas_en_OCaml](http://fr.wikiversity.org/wiki/Premiers_pas_en_OCaml)
 (in French):

tools and libraries.

These tutorials help learn OCaml from the perspective of being familiar
with another language.
