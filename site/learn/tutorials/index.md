# OCaml tutorials

#### Your Help is Needed
Some of the tutorials above need updating and tutorials on new topics are
needed. You can contribute by visiting this project's repo on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org); you may use the issue tracker
there to request or offer new tutorials.

### Learn by Doing

* [Try OCaml Online](http://try.ocamlpro.com/) allows
 you to immediately start learning OCaml in your browser, without
 installing it. Compiled as a single Javascript page, it gives you
 the full power of OCaml, even when your are disconnected from the
 network.
* [PLEAC-OCaml](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_ocaml/) provides
 OCaml solutions to the complete set of problems originally posed in
 the very successful Perl Cookbook. OCaml is one of only 3 languages
 for which the full set of solutions has been provided.
* [Rosetta](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:OCaml) is a
 programming chrestomathy site. It provides solutions to the same
 task in many languages. Currently there are few tasks with OCaml
 solutions provided, but perhaps you would like to add new solutions.

### Tutorials on OCaml

* [The OCaml System](/releases/latest/manual.html) is the official user's
  manual. The first part provides an introduction to the core language, objects
  and classes, and modules.  Previous versions are
  [here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/).
* [OCaml for scientific
  computation](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/software/ocamltutorial/)
  covers a broad sample of OCaml, from the basics to the C API.
* [OCaml for Haskellers](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/10/ocaml-for-haskellers/)
  Some notes on the differences between OCaml and Haskell.

### WikiBooks on OCaml

Both in french:
* [fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/OCaml](http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/OCaml)
  Introduction on functional programming using OCaml.
* [fr.wikiversity.org/wiki/Premiers_pas_en_OCaml](http://fr.wikiversity.org/wiki/Premiers_pas_en_OCaml)
  The basics of the OCaml language.

### Tutorials on Tools and Other Articles

* [Camlp5](camlp5.html), a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for OCaml.
* [A Guide to Extension Points in OCaml](http://whitequark.org/blog/2014/04/16/a-guide-to-extension-points-in-ocaml/),
  on using PPX, the syntax extensions API.
* [Detecting use cases for GADTs in OCaml](http://mads-hartmann.com/ocaml/2015/01/05/gadt-ocaml.html),
  on using generalized algebraic data types in writing interpreters.
