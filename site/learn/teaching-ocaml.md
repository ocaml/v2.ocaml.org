# Teaching OCaml

OCaml is a high-level language that supports functional, imperative
and object-oriented programming styles. As such, it is an excellent
tool for teaching the fundamental concepts behind programming
languages, type theory and systems.

For the full description of the benefits of the OCaml language
please refer to the article on
“[Why OCaml?](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/prologue.html)”.

This page is devoted to resources for people who are teaching OCaml in
a University setting. It contains a list of courses in different
Universities that use OCaml as a teaching language. It can help with
setting up a course structure as well as finding the relevant contacts
to discuss and share experiences. We also include relevant resources
such as references to commonly used textbooks and tools for
setting up your preferred environment to work with OCaml. We hope that
this will make the task of shaping a programming course that uses
OCaml a slightly easier task.

**Don't worry if things do not work**! OCaml has a vibrant and rapidly
  growing community behind it that is eager to help. If you find any
  problems with any of the tutorials or something is missing please
  let us know by
  [getting in touch](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching) so we
  can help in making your experience with OCaml more pleasant. If you
  would like to add your course or other resources please feel free to
  [create an issue](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/new).

### Mailing list
We set-up a [mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching) for professors who are teaching OCaml in schools and universities to discuss issues relating to using OCaml in an educational context.

# Resources


## Suggested Textbooks


This is a list of books and lecture notes that are being used for
teaching OCaml. There is also a wider list of books to choose from, which you can find on the [books page](http://ocaml.org/learn/books.html).

1. [The OCaml System: Documentation and User's Manual](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/) This the official User's Manual. It serves as a complete reference guide to OCaml. Updated for each version of OCaml, it contains the description of the language, of its extensions, and the documentation of the tools and libraries included in the official distribution.

1. [Lecture notes](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/notes/120notes.pdf)
   for Penn's CIS120.  Like the course, this book covers both OCaml
   and Java, and is intended for students with no programming
   background.
1. [Real World OCaml](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do),
   also available [online](https://realworldocaml.org/).  Used by Harvard's CS51 course.
1. Jason Hickey's [Introduction to Objective Caml](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf),
   originally developed as lecture notes for Jason's course at Caltech



## Teaching tools

This section lists some of the available tools that are or can be used in a classroom or lab.

### In the browser

The OCaml bytecode is relatively straightforward to convert to Javascript. This allows any OCaml code to run in a Web browser, which is very convenient when delivering individual tutorials to a class as there's minimal set up time involved.

For a quick example of OCaml in the browser, try any of the following:

1. [IOCaml Notebooks](https://github.com/andrewray/iocaml/blob/master/README.md)
1. [A compiler from OCaml bytecode to Javascript](http://ocsigen.github.io/js_of_ocaml/)
1. [Try OCaml](http://try.ocamlpro.com/)
1. [Compile OCaml Online](http://www.compileonline.com/compile_ocaml_online.php)
1. [Codepad](http://codepad.org/)
1. [Run OCaml Code Online](https://dbgr.cc/l/ocaml)


### OCaml installation
