# OCaml 4.12.0
This page describes OCaml version **4.12.0**, released on
2021-02-24.  Go [here](./) for a list of all releases.

This release is available as an
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) switch.

What's new
----------
Some of the highlights in OCaml 4.12.0 are:

- Major progress in reducing the difference between the mainline and
  multicore runtime
- A new configuration option `ocaml-option-nnpchecker` which emits an alarm
  when the garbage collector finds out-of-heap pointers that could cause a crash
  in the multicore runtime
- Support for macOS/arm64
- Mnemonic names for warnings
- Many quality of life improvements
- Many bug fixes

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](#Changes).

Configuration options
---------------------

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- ocaml-option-32bit: set OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- ocaml-option-afl: set OCaml to be compiled with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- ocaml-option-bytecode-only: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- ocaml-option-default-unsafe-string: set OCaml to be compiled without safe strings by default
- ocaml-option-flambda: set OCaml to be compiled with flambda activated
- ocaml-option-fp: set OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled
- ocaml-option-musl: set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc
- ocaml-option-nnp : set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-naked-pointers
- ocaml-option-nnpchecker: set OCaml to be compiled with --enable-naked-pointers-checker
- ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array: set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-flat-float-array
- ocaml-option-static :set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc -static

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 4.12.0+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.4.12.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

Changes
-------

This is the
[changelog](4.12/notes/Changes).
(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a  "breaking change" warning)

### Supported platforms (highlights):

- [9699](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9699): add support for iOS and macOS on ARM 64 bits
  (Eduardo Rafael, review by Xavier Leroy, Nicolás Ojeda Bär
   and Anil Madhavapeddy, additional testing by Michael Schmidt)

### Standard library (highlights):

- [9797](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9797): Add Sys.mkdir and Sys.rmdir.
  (David Allsopp, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Sébastien Hinderer and
   Xavier Leroy)

* [*breaking change*] [9765](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9765): add init functions to Bigarray.
  (Jeremy Yallop, review by Gabriel Scherer, Nicolás Ojeda Bär, and
   Xavier Leroy)

* [*breaking change*] [9668](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9668): List.equal, List.compare
  (This could break code using "open List" by shadowing
   Stdlib.{equal,compare}.)
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Daniel Bünzli and Alain Frisch)

- [9066](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9066): a new Either module with
  type 'a Either.t = Left of 'a | Right of 'b
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Daniel Bünzli, Thomas Refis, Jeremy Yallop)

- [9066](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9066): List.partition_map :
    ('a -> ('b, 'c) Either.t) -> 'a list -> 'b list * 'c list
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Jeremy Yallop)

- [9865](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9865): add Format.pp_print_seq
  (Raphaël Proust, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

### Compiler user-interface and warnings (highlights):

- [9657](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9657): Warnings can now be referred to by their mnemonic name. The names are
  displayed using `-warn-help` and can be utilized anywhere where a warning list
  specification is expected.
      ocamlc -w +fragile-match
      ...[@@ocaml.warning "-fragile-match"]
  Note that only a single warning name at a time is supported for now:
  "-w +foo-bar" does not work, you must use "-w +foo -w -bar".
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Gabriel Scherer, Florian Angeletti and
   Leo White)

- [8939](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8939): Command-line option to save Linear IR before emit.
  (Greta Yorsh, review by Mark Shinwell, Sébastien Hinderer and Frédéric Bour)

- [9003](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9003): Start compilation from Emit when the input file is in Linear IR format.
  (Greta Yorsh, review by Jérémie Dimino, Gabriel Scherer and Frédéric Bour)

### Language features (highlights):

* [*breaking change*] [9500](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9500), [9727](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9727), [9866](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9866), [9870](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9870), [9873](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9873): Injectivity annotations
  One can now mark type parameters as injective, which is useful for
  abstract types:
    module Vec : sig type !'a t end = struct type 'a t = 'a array end
  On non-abstract types, this can be used to check the injectivity of
  parameters. Since all parameters of record and sum types are by definition
  injective, this only makes sense for type abbreviations:
    type !'a t = 'a list
  Note that this change required making the regularity check stricter.
  (Jacques Garrigue, review by Jeremy Yallop and Leo White)

### Runtime system (highlights):

- [9534](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9534), [9947](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9947): Introduce a naked pointers checker mode to the runtime
  (configure option --enable-naked-pointers-checker).  Alarms are printed
  when the garbage collector finds out-of-heap pointers that could
  cause a crash in no-naked-pointers mode.
  (Enguerrand Decorne, KC Sivaramakrishnan, Xavier Leroy, Stephen Dolan,
  David Allsopp, Nicolás Ojeda Bär review by Xavier Leroy, Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

* [*breaking change*] [1128](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/1128), [7503](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/7503), [9036](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9036), [9722](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9722), [10069](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10069): EINTR-based signal handling.
  When a signal arrives, avoid running its OCaml handler in the middle
  of a blocking section. Instead, allow control to return quickly to
  a polling point where the signal handler can safely run, ensuring that
  I/O locks are not held while it runs. A polling point was removed from
  caml_leave_blocking_section, and one added to caml_raise.
  (Stephen Dolan, review by Goswin von Brederlow, Xavier Leroy, Damien
   Doligez, Anil Madhavapeddy, Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni and Jacques-
   Henri Jourdan)

* [*breaking change*] [5154](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/5154), [9569](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9569), [9734](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9734): Add `Val_none`, `Some_val`, `Is_none`, `Is_some`,
  `caml_alloc_some`, and `Tag_some`. As these macros are sometimes defined by
  authors of C bindings, this change may cause warnings/errors in case of
  redefinition.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Stephen Dolan, Gabriel Scherer, Mark Shinwell,
  and Xavier Leroy)

* [*breaking change*] [9674](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9674): Memprof: guarantee that an allocation callback is always run
  in the same thread the allocation takes place
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Stephen Dolan)

- [10025](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10025): Track custom blocks (e.g. Bigarray) with Memprof

   Jourdan)

- [9619](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9619): Change representation of function closures so that code pointers

- [9655](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9655): Obj: introduce type raw_data and functions raw_field, set_raw_field

  Now, unlocking a mutex held by another thread or not locked at all
  reliably raises a Sys_error exception.  Before, it was undefined
  behavior, but the documentation did not say so.
  Likewise, locking a mutex already locked by the current thread
  reliably raises a Sys_error exception.  Before, it could
  deadlock or succeed (and do recursive locking), depending on the OS.
