![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution
---------------------------------------------

- [Source
  tarball](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.11.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
- Also available in
  [.zip](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.11.0.zip)
  format.
- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.
- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The
[INSTALL](4.11/notes/INSTALL.adoc) file
of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instructions — see also the [Windows release
notes](4.11/notes/README.win32.adoc) for
instructions on how to build under Windows.

Alternative Compilers
---------------------

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.
* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/) is a
  newer OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml) for
  an explanation of how it differs from `js_of_ocaml`.
* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.

Changes

This is the
[changelog](4.11/notes/Changes).
(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a  "*breaking change" warning)

### Runtime system:

- [#9096](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9096): Print function names in backtraces.
  Old output:
```
Called from file "foo.ml", line 16, characters 42-53
```
  New output:
```
Called from Foo.bar in file "foo.ml", line 16, characters 42-53
```
  (Stephen Dolan, review by Leo White and Mark Shinwell)

- [#9082](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9082): The instrumented runtime now records logs in the CTF format.
  A new API is available in the runtime to collect runtime statistics,
  replacing the previous instrumented runtime macros.
  Gc.eventlog_pause and Gc.eventlog_resume were added to allow user to control
  instrumentation in a running program.
  See the manual for more information on how to use this instrumentation mode.

  Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Shakthi Kannan, KC Sivaramakrishnan, Gabriel Scherer,
  Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Damien Doligez, Leo White, Daniel Bünzli
  and Xavier Leroy)

- [#9230](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9230), [#9362](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9362): Memprof support for native allocations.

  registering callbacks for promotion and deallocation of memory
  blocks.
  The new API no longer gives the block tags to the allocation callback.
  (Stephen Dolan and Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Damien Doligez
   and Gabriel Scherer)

- [#9353](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9353): Reimplement `output_value` and the `Marshal.to_*` functions

* \[*breaking change*\] [#9197](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9197): remove compatibility logic from [#244](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/244) that was designed to
  synchronize toplevel printing margins with Format.std_formatter,
  but also resulted in unpredictable/fragile changes to formatter
  margins.
  Setting the margins on the desired formatters should now work.
  typically on `Format.std_formatter`.
  Note that there currently is no robust way to do this from the
  toplevel, as applications may redirect toplevel printing. In
  a compiler/toplevel driver, one should instead access
  `Location.formatter_for_warnings`; it is not currently exposed
  to the toplevel.
