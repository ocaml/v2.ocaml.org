![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution
---------------------------------------------

- [Source
  tarball](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.07.1.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
- Also available in
  [.zip](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.07.1.zip)
  format.
- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.
- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The
[INSTALL](4.07/notes/INSTALL.adoc) file
of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instructions -- see also the [Windows release
notes](4.07/notes/README.win32.adoc) for
instructions on how to build under Windows.

Alternative Compilers
---------------------

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.
* [Bucklescript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) is a
  newer OCaml to JavaScript compiler.  See the
  [comparison to Js_of_ocaml](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/comparison-to-jsoo).
  Bucklescript may take some time to be compatible with the latest
  release of OCaml.
* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.
