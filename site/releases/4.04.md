## ![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution

- [Source
  tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/ocaml-4.04.1.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).

- Also available in
  [.tar.xz](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/ocaml-4.04.1.tar.xz)
  format.

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.

- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The [INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/notes/INSTALL.adoc)
file of the distribution provides detailed compilation and
installation instructions.


## ![](../img/linux.gif "") Binary distributions for Linux

Binary distributions for CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu are
available
[here](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aocaml&package=ocaml).


## ![](../img/windows.gif "") Binary distribution for Microsoft Windows

Four ports of OCaml for Microsoft Windows are currently available. For
additional information, please consult the list of [portability
issues](/learn/portability.html) or the
[Windows release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/notes/README.win32.adoc).

- [Cygwin-based native Win32
  port](http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/). A self
  installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical user
  interface. Some features require the Cygwin environment, which the
  installer can fetch for you. However, the compilers are, and
  generate true Win32 executables, which do not require Cygwin to run.

- Microsoft-based native Win32 port. No binary distribution available
  yet; download the source distribution and compile it.

- [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)-based port. Requires Cygwin. No
  graphical user interface is provided. The compilers generate
  executables that do require Cygwin. The precompiled binaries are
  part of the Cygwin distribution; you can install them using the
  Cygwin setup tool. Alternatively, download the source distribution
  and compile it under Cygwin.

- Microsoft-based native Win64 port Same features as the
  Microsoft-based native Win32 port, but generates 64-bit code. No
  binary distribution available yet; download the source distribution
  and compile it.


## Precompiled binaries for Solaris

Available at [sunfreeware.com](http://sunfreeware.com/).


## Alternative Compilers

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.

* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/) is a newer
  OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml)
  for an explanation of how it differs from js_of_ocaml.

* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.
