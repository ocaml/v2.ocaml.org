For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/notes/Changes). There

### Security Updates

The 4.04.2 release features an important security update, described in
the security advisory below.

```
CVE-2017-9772: Privilege escalation in OCaml runtime for SUID executables

The environment variables CAML_CPLUGINS, CAML_NATIVE_CPLUGINS, and
CAML_BYTE_CPLUGINS can be used to auto-load code into any ocamlopt-compiled
executable or any ocamlc-compiled executable in ‘custom runtime mode’.
This can lead to privilege escalation if the executable is marked setuid.

Vulnerable versions: OCaml 4.04.0 and 4.04.1

Workarounds:
  - Upgrade to OCaml 4.04.2 or higher.
or - Compile the OCaml distribution with the "-no-cplugins" configure option.
or - OPAM users can "opam update && opam switch recompile 4.04.1", as
    the repository has had backported patches applied.

Impact: This only affects binaries that have been installed on Unix-like
operating systems (including Linux and macOS) with the setuid bit set.
However, in that situation, any user who execute the program gains all
the privileges of the owner of the executable (meaning that root-owned
setuid executables provide root access).

Fix: OCaml 4.04.2 mitigates this by modifying Sys.getenv and Unix.getenv
to raise an exception if the process has ever had elevated privileges.
The OCaml runtime has also been modified to use this function for
retrieving all of the runtime environment variables which could potentially
cause files to be accessed or modified.  The older behaviour is available
in the `caml_sys_unsafe_getenv` primitive for applications that require
strict compatibility.

## What's new

Some of the highlights in release 4.04 are:

- Exceptions can be declared locally within an expression, with syntax
  `let exception ... in ...`

- Optimized memory representation for immutable records with a single
  field, and concrete types with a single constructor with a single
  argument. This is triggered with a `@@unboxed` attribute on the type
  definition.

- Support for the Spacetime memory profiler was added.

bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the

## ![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution

- [Source
  tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/ocaml-4.04.2.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).

- Also available in
  [.tar.xz](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/ocaml-4.04.2.tar.xz)
  format.

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.

- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The [INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/notes/INSTALL.adoc)
file of the distribution provides detailed compilation and
installation instructions.


## ![](../img/linux.gif "") Binary distributions for Linux

Binary distributions for CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu are
available
[here](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aocaml&package=ocaml).


## ![](../img/windows.gif "") Binary distribution for Microsoft Windows

Four ports of OCaml for Microsoft Windows are currently available. For
additional information, please consult the list of [portability
issues](/learn/portability.html) or the
[Windows release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/notes/README.win32.adoc).

- [Cygwin-based native Win32
  port](http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/). A self
  installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical user
  interface. Some features require the Cygwin environment, which the
  installer can fetch for you. However, the compilers are, and
  generate true Win32 executables, which do not require Cygwin to run.

- Microsoft-based native Win32 port. No binary distribution available
  yet; download the source distribution and compile it.

- [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)-based port. Requires Cygwin. No
  graphical user interface is provided. The compilers generate
  executables that do require Cygwin. The precompiled binaries are
  part of the Cygwin distribution; you can install them using the
  Cygwin setup tool. Alternatively, download the source distribution
  and compile it under Cygwin.

- Microsoft-based native Win64 port Same features as the
  Microsoft-based native Win32 port, but generates 64-bit code. No
  binary distribution available yet; download the source distribution
  and compile it.


## Precompiled binaries for Solaris

Available at [sunfreeware.com](http://sunfreeware.com/).


## Alternative Compilers

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.

* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/) is a newer
  OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml)
  for an explanation of how it differs from js_of_ocaml.

* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.
