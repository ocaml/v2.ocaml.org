Changes
-------

### Build system:

- [9938](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9938), [9939](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9939): Define __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0 for the mingw-w64 ports to
  prevent their C99-compliant snprintf conflicting with ours.
  (David Allsopp, report by Michael Soegtrop, review by Xavier Leroy)

### Runtime system:

- [10056](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10056): Memprof: ensure young_trigger is within the bounds of the minor
  heap in caml_memprof_renew_minor_sample (regression from [8684](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8684))
  (David Allsopp, review by Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni and
  Jacques-Henri Jourdan)

- [9654](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9654): More efficient management of code fragments.
  (Xavier Leroy, review by Jacques-Henri Jourdan, Damien Doligez, and
  Stephen Dolan)

### Tools:

- [9606](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9606), [9635](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9635), [9637](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9637): fix performance regression in the debugger
  (behaviors quadratic in the size of the debugged program)
  (Xavier Leroy, report by Jacques Garrigue and Virgile Prevosto,
  review by David Allsopp and Jacques-Henri Jourdan)

### Code generation and optimizations:

- [9969](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9969), [9981](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9981): Added mergeable flag to ELF sections containing mergeable
  constants.  Fixes compatibility with the integrated assembler in clang 11.0.0.
  (Jacob Young, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

### Bug fixes:

- [9970](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9970), [10010](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10010): fix the declaration scope of extensible-datatype constructors.
  A regression that dates back to 4.08 makes extensible-datatype constructors
  with inline records very fragile, for example:
    type 'a t += X of {x : 'a}
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Thomas Refis and Leo White,
   report by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

- [9096](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9096), [10096](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10096): fix a 4.11.0 performance regression in classes/objects
  declared within a function
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Leo White, report by Sacha Ayoun)

- [9326](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9326), [10125](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10125): Gc.set incorrectly handles the three `custom_*` fields,
  causing a performance regression
  (report by Emilio Jesús Gallego Arias, analysis and fix by Stephen Dolan,
   code by Xavier Leroy, review by Hugo Heuzard and Gabriel Scherer)
