# OCaml 4.14.0
This page describes OCaml version **4.14.0**, released on
2022-03-28.  Go [here](./) for a list of all releases.

This release is available as an
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) switch.

What's new
----------
Some of the highlights in OCaml 4.14.0 are:

- Integrated support for "go to definitions" in Merlin.
- Standard library: new modules In_channel and Out_channel,
  many new functions in Seq module, UTF decoding and validation support
  for strings and bytes.
- Runtime optimisation: GC prefetching. Benchmarks show a speedup of around 20%
  in GC-heavy programs.
- Improved error messages in particular for module-level error.
- Deprecated functions and modules in preparation for OCaml 5.
  In particular, the Stream and Genlex modules are now deprecated.
- Type variables can be explicitly introduced in value and variant constructor
  declarations. For instance,
```ocaml
    val fold: ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
    type showable = Show: 'a * ('a -> string) -> showable
```
can now be written as
```ocaml
    val fold: 'acc 'elt. ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
    type showable = Show: 'a. 'a * ('a -> string) -> showable
```
- Tail-call with up to 64 arguments are now guaranteed to be optimized
  for all architectures.
- Experimental tail modulo cons (TMC) transformation

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](#Changes).

Configuration options
---------------------

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- ocaml-option-32bit: set OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- ocaml-option-afl: set OCaml to be compiled with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- ocaml-option-bytecode-only: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- ocaml-option-default-unsafe-string: set OCaml to be compiled without safe strings by default
- ocaml-option-flambda: set OCaml to be compiled with flambda activated
- ocaml-option-fp: set OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled
- ocaml-option-musl: set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc
- ocaml-option-nnp : set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-naked-pointers
- ocaml-option-nnpchecker: set OCaml to be compiled with --enable-naked-pointers-checker
- ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array: set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-flat-float-array
- ocaml-option-static :set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc -static

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 4.14.0+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 4.14.0+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

  in Types.Transient_expr).
  (Jacques Garrigue and Takafumi Saikawa,
   review by Florian Angeletti and Gabriel Radanne)

- [#10474](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10474): Force normalization on access to row_desc

  (Jacques Garrigue and Takafumi Saikawa, review by Florian Angeletti)

- [#10433](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10433): Remove the distinction between 32-bit aligned and 64-bit aligned

   Vincent Laviron)

- [#10473](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10473): Add CFI directives to RISC-V runtime and asmcomp.

  (Edwin Török, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär and Xavier Leroy)

- [#10539](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10539): Field kinds should be kept when copying types
  Losing the sharing meant that one could desynchronize them between several
  occurrences of self, allowing a method to be both public and hidden,
  which broke type soundness.
  (Jacques Garrigue, review by Leo White)

- [#10542](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10542): Fix detection of immediate64 types through unboxed types.

- [#10677](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10677), [#10679](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10679): Fix detection of CC as gcc in configure (allow for
  triplet-prefixed GCC) and fix all C compiler detection when CC is a path
  rather than a basename.
  (David Allsopp, report by Fabian @copy, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- [#10690](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10690): Add --enable-native-toplevel to configure to enable installing

- [#10836](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10836), [#10952](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10952): avoid internal typechecker errors when checking signature
  inclusion in presence of incompatible types.
  (Florian Angeletti, report by Craig Ferguson, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- [#10849](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10849): Display the result of `let _ : <type> = <expr>` in the native
