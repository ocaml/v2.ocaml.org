# OCaml 4.02.0
This page describes the most recent OCaml, version **4.02.0**,
released on 2014-08-29. Go [here](./) for a list of all releases.


## What's New

Some of the highlights in release 4.02 are:

- In a first step towards making strings immutable, a type bytes of
  mutable byte arrays and a supporting library module `Bytes` were
  introduced. By default, `bytes` is a synonym for `string`, so
  existing code that mutates values of type `string` still compiles,
  with warnings. Option `-safe-string` separates the types `string`
  and `bytes`, making strings immutable.

- The `match` construct was extended to discriminate not just on the
  value of its argument expression, but also on exceptions arising out
  of the evaluation of this expression. This solves an old problem: in
  a `let x = a in b`, catch exceptions raised by `a` but not those
  raised by `b`.

- Module aliases (giving an alternative name to an existing module or
  compilation unit, as in `module M = AnotherModule`) are now tracked
  specially by the type system and the compiler. This enables not only
  more precise typing of applicative functors, but also more precise
  dependency analysis at link-time, potentially reducing the size of
  executables.

- Annotations can now be attached to most syntactic elements of OCaml
  sources (expressions, definitions, type declarations, etc). These
  annotations are used by the compiler (e.g. to warn on uses of
  functions annotated as deprecated) but also by "ppx" preprocessors,
  to guide rewriting of abstract syntax trees.

- Extensible data types can be declared (`type t = ..`) then later
  extended with new constructors (`type t += A of int`). This
  generalizes the handling of the exn type of exception values.

- Functors and functor applications can now take a special () argument
  to force generativity of abstract types.

- New toplevel directives `#show_type`, `#show_modules`, etc, to query
  the toplevel environment.

- Performance of `ocamlopt`-generated code is improved on some
  programs through more aggressive constant propagation, two new
  optimization passes (dead code elimination and common subexpression
  elimination), better compilation of pattern-matching over strings,
  optimized representation of constant exceptions, and GC tuning for
  large memory heaps.

- The format strings argument of `printf` functions are now
  represented as a GADT. This speeds up the `printf` functions
  considerably, and leads to more precise typechecking of format
  strings.

- The native-code compiler now supports the AArch64 (ARM 64 bits)
  architecture.

- The Camlp4 preprocessor and the Labltk library were split off the
  distribution. They are now separate projects.

## ![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution

- [Source
  tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.02/ocaml-4.02.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).

- Also available in
  [.tar.xz](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.02/ocaml-4.02.0.tar.xz)
  format.

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.

- You also have read-only [SVN access](svn.html) to the working
  sources and to all previous public releases.

The [INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.02/notes/INSTALL)
file of the distribution provides detailed compilation and
installation instruction.


## ![](../img/linux.gif "") Binary distributions for Linux

Binary distributions for CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu are
available
[here](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aocaml&package=ocaml).


## ![](../img/windows.gif "") Binary distribution for Microsoft Windows

Four ports of OCaml for Microsoft Windows are currently available. For
additional information, please consult the list of [portability
issues](/learn/portability.html) or the
[Windows release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.02/notes/README.win32).

- [Cygwin-based native Win32
  port](http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/). A self
  installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical user
  interface. Some features require the Cygwin environment, which the
  installer can fetch for you. However, the compilers are, and
  generate true Win32 executables, which do not require Cygwin to run.

- Microsoft-based native Win32 port. No binary distribution available
  yet; download the source distribution and compile it.

- [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)-based port. Requires Cygwin. No
  graphical user interface is provided. The compilers generate
  executables that do require Cygwin. The precompiled binaries are
  part of the Cygwin distribution; you can install them using the
  Cygwin setup tool. Alternatively, download the source distribution
  and compile it under Cygwin.

- Microsoft-based native Win64 port Same features as the
  Microsoft-based native Win32 port, but generates 64-bit code. No
  binary distribution available yet; download the source distribution
  and compile it.


## Precompiled binaries for Solaris

Available at [sunfreeware.com](http://sunfreeware.com/).


## Alternative Compilers

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* The [js_of_ocaml project](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/), an OCaml
  to Javascript compiler (stable)

* The [ocaml-java project](http://www.ocamljava.org/), an OCaml to
  Java compiler (stable)
