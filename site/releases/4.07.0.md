files.

This release is available as multiple
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) switches:

- 4.07.0 — Official 4.07.0 release
- 4.07.0+afl — Official 4.07.0 release with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- 4.07.0+default-unsafe-string — Official 4.07.0 release without safe
  strings by default

  flambda activated

What's new
----------

Some of the highlights in release 4.07 are:

- The standard library is now packed into a module called `Stdlib`, which is
  open by default. This makes it easier to add new modules to the standard
  library without clashing with user-defined modules.

- The `Bigarray` module is now part of the standard library.

- The modules `Seq`, `Float` were added to the standard library.

- Improvements to several error and warning messages printed by the
  compiler make them much easier to understand.

- Many imporovements to flambda.

- Support for ARMv8 in 32-bit mode.

- Removed the dependency on curses/terminfo/termcap.

- The SpaceTime profiler now works under Windows.

bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the

---------------------------------------------

- [Source
  tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07/ocaml-4.07.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
- Also available in
  [.tar.xz](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07/ocaml-4.07.0.tar.xz)
  format.
- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.
- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The
[INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07/notes/INSTALL.adoc) file
of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instructions -- see also the [Windows release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07/notes/README.win32.adoc) for
instructions on how to build under Windows.

Alternative Compilers
---------------------

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.
* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/) is a
  newer OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml) for
  an explanation of how it differs from js_of_ocaml.
* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.

Changes
-------

This is the
[changelog](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07/notes/Changes).

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

- MPR#6023, GPR#1648: Allow type-based selection of GADT constructors
  (Thomas Refis and Leo White, review by Jacques Garrigue and Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#1546: Allow empty variants
  (Runhang Li, review by Gabriel Radanne and Jacques Garrigue)

### Standard library:

  (Christophe Troestler, review by Damien Doligez)

- MPR#6139, GPR#1685: Move the Bigarray module to the standard library. Keep the
  bigarray library as on overlay adding the deprecated map_file functions

  (Simon Cruanes, review by Alain Frisch and François Bobot)

* GPR#1010: pack all standard library modules into a single module Stdlib
  which is the default opened module (Stdlib itself includes Pervasives) to free
  up the global namespace for other standard libraries, while still allowing any
  OCaml standard library module to be referred to as Stdlib.Module). This is
  implemented efficiently using module aliases (prefixing all modules with
  Stdlib__, e.g. Stdlib__string).

   and Gabriel Radanne)
