# OCaml 4.13.0
This page describes OCaml version **4.13.0**, released on
2021-09-24.  Go [here](./) for a list of all releases.

This release is available as an
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) switch.

What's new
----------
Some of the highlights in OCaml 4.13.0 are:

- Safe points: a multicore prerequisite that ensures that ocamlopt-generated code can always be interrupted.
- The best-fit GC allocation policy is the now default policy (and many other GCs   improvements.
- Named existential type variables in pattern matching  `Showable (type a) (x, show : a * (a -> string))`.
- Improved error messages for functor application and functor types.
- Let-punning for monadic let: `let* x = x in` can be shortened to `let* x in`.
- Module type substitutions `SIG with module type T = F(X).S`.
- Many other quality of life improvements
- Many bug fixes 

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](#Changes).

Configuration options
---------------------

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- ocaml-option-32bit: set OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- ocaml-option-afl: set OCaml to be compiled with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- ocaml-option-bytecode-only: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- ocaml-option-default-unsafe-string: set OCaml to be compiled without safe strings by default
- ocaml-option-flambda: set OCaml to be compiled with flambda activated
- ocaml-option-fp: set OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled
- ocaml-option-musl: set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc
- ocaml-option-nnp : set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-naked-pointers
- ocaml-option-nnpchecker: set OCaml to be compiled with --enable-naked-pointers-checker
- ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array: set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-flat-float-array
- ocaml-option-static :set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc -static

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 4.13.0+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.4.13.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 4.13.0+flambda+nnpchecker ocaml-variants.4.13.0+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

  experimental.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by David Allsopp)

- [#10194](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10194): Change compaction-triggering heuristic: use the overhead measured
  by the previous GC cycle instead of an indirect (and noisy) computation
  of the current overhead.
  (Damien Doligez, review by Stephen Dolan)

- [#10549](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10549): Stack overflow detection and naked pointers checking for ARM64

- [#9876](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9876): do not cache the young_limit GC variable in a processor register.
  This affects the ARM64, PowerPC and RISC-V ports, making signal handling
  and minor GC triggers more reliable, at the cost of a small slowdown.
  (Xavier Leroy, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

  frame pointers mode enabled.
  (David Allsopp, review by Vincent Laviron and Mark Shinwell)

### Standard library:

- [#944](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/944): Add some missing C99 float operations.  `Stdlib` now contains
  the inverse hyperbolic functions `acosh`, `asinh`, and `atanh`.  These
  functions were also added to module `Stdlib.Float` together with `exp2`,
  `log2`, `cbrt`, `erf`, and `erfc`. Full support on MSVC requires VS2013+ but
  emulated versions are still available (for now) for older compilers.
  (Markus Mottl, review by David Allsopp, Olivier Andrieu, Florian Angeletti,
  Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Daniel Bünzli, Fabian @copy, Pascal Cuoq, Damien
  Doligez, Sébastien Hinderer, Jacques-Henri Jourdan, Xavier Leroy, Guillaume
  Melquiond, Perry E. Metzger, @objmagic, Gabriel Scherer, Mark Shinwell,
  Bernhard Schommer and Christophe Troestler)

  String.{of,to}_bytes as aliases of Bytes.{to,of}_string,
  Bytes.split_on_char as dual of String.split_on_char, and binary decoding
  functions in String to match those in Bytes.
  (David Allsopp, review by Damien Doligez, Gabriel Scherer and others)

- [#9487](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9487), [#9489](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9489): Add Random.full_int which allows 62-bit bounds on 64-bit
  systems.
  (David Allsopp, request by Francois Berenger, review by Xavier Leroy and
   Damien Doligez)

- [#9533](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9533): Added String.starts_with and String.ends_with.
  (Bernhard Schommer, review by Daniel Bünzli, Gabriel Scherer and
  Alain Frisch)

- [#9582](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9582): Add Array.{find_opt,find_map,split,combine}.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Daniel Bünzli and Gabriel Scherer)

- [#9961](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9961): Add Array.fold_left_map.
  (Craig Ferguson, review by Damien Doligez)

- [#10097](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10097): Lazy.map, Lazy.map_val: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a Lazy.t -> 'b Lazy.t
  (map f x) is always (lazy (f (force x))), whereas (map_val f x)
  applies f directly if x is already forced.
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Alain Frisch, Xavier Leroy,
   Daniel Bünzli and Stephen Dolan)

* [*breaking change*] [#10169](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10169), [#10270](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10270), [#10301](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10301), [#10451](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10451): Use capitalized module names in the Standard
  Library prefixing scheme to match Dune, e.g. Stdlib__String instead of
  Stdlib__string. This is a breaking change only to code which attempted to use
  the internal names before. The Standard Library generated by the Dune rules is
  now equivalent to the main build (the Dune rules still do not generate a
  distributable compiler).
  (David Allsopp and Mark Shinwell, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- [#10242](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10242): Added convenience pretty printer for Either.t in the Format module.
  (Oghenevwogaga Ebresafe, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär,
  Gabriel Scherer and Xavier Van de Woestyne)

- [#10352](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10352): Seq.(concat : 'a t t -> 'a t)
  Seq.concat_map as an alias to Seq.flat_map,
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Ulugbek Abdullaev and Daniel Bünzli
   and Nicolás Ojeda Bär and Florian Angeletti)

  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär and Alain Frisch, review by Xavier Leroy)

- [#10430](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10430): Add Format.print_bytes and Format.pp_print_bytes.
  (Gabriel Radanne, review by Gabriel Scherer and David Allsopp)

### Other libraries:

- [#10047](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10047): Add `Unix.realpath`
  (Daniel Bünzli, review by David Allsopp, Josh Berdine and Gabriel Scherer)

* [*breaking change*] [#10084](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10084): Unix.open_process_args* functions now look up the program in the PATH.
  This was already the case under Windows, but this is now also done under
  Unix. Note that previously the program was interpreted relative to the current
  directory.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Gabriel Scherer and Xavier Leroy)

- [#10184](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10184): Remove expensive debug assertion from dynlink.

  functions (Antonin Décimo, review by David Allsopp)

- [#10309](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10309): Properly return EBADF on error in Unix.descr_of_{in,out}_channel on
  Win32 and map Windows error correctly in Unix.truncate and Unix.ftruncate on
  Win32.
  (David Allsopp, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

### Tools:

- [#8645](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8645), [#10363](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10363): ocamldoc: escape `<`, `>`, and `&` in html backend.

### Compiler user-interface and warnings:

- [#1737](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/1737), [#2092](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/2092), [#7852](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/7852), [#7859](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/7859), [#10405](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10405), [#10417](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10417): Update locations during
  destructive substitutions
  (Thomas Refis, review by Gabriel Radanne, report by Hugo Heuzard)

- [#2245](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/2245): Improve error message for link order error in bytecode
  (Pierre Chambart, review by Jérémie Dimino and Gabriel Scherer)

- [#8732](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8732), improved error messages for invalid private row type definitions.
  For instance, [ type t = private [< `A > `A ] ] .
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Jacques Garrigue, Thomas Refis,
   and Gabriel Scherer)

- [#9407](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9407): added warning for missing mli interface file
  (Anukriti Kumar, review by Florian Angeletti)

- [#9960](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9960), [#10619](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10619): extend ocamlc/ocamlopt's -o option to work when
  compiling C files
  (Sébastien Hinderer, reported by Daniel Bünzli, review by
  Florian Angeletti and Gabriel Scherer)

- [#10095](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10095): simplify the syntax error messages produced by the compiler.
  In many cases, the compiler would produce an error message that looked
  potentially helpful but was actually misguided and arguably confusing,
  because the error message implicitly referred to an earlier point in
  the source code than the point explicitly shown in the error message.
  (François Pottier, review by Gabriel Scherer and Frédéric Bour.)

* [*breaking change*] [#10118](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10118), [#10140](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10140): enable warning 6 [labels-omitted] by default.
  The following now warns:
    let f ~x y = ... in f 3 5
  the callsite (f 3 5) has to be turned into (f ~x:3 5).
  This prevents mistakes where two arguments of the same types are swapped.
  (Note: Dune already enables this warning by default.)
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Xavier Leroy and Florian Angeletti,
   report by ygrek)

- [#10196](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10196), [#10197](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10197): better error message on empty character literals ''.
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by David Allsopp and Florian Angeletti
   and Daniel Bünzli, report by Robin Björklin)

- [#8877](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8877): Call the linker when ocamlopt is invoked with .o and .a files only.
  (Greta Yorsh, review by Leo White)

- [#10207](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10207), [#10312](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10312): deprecate consecutive letters in warning
  specifications.
  The form `-w aBcD` was equivalent to `-w -a+b-c+d`.
  It is now deprecated to improve the coexistence with warning mnemonics.
  However, using isolated single letter is not deprecated to allow the form
  `-w "A-32..50-45"`.

  (Anukriti Kumar, review by Vincent Laviron and David Allsop)

- [#10007](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10007): Driver.compile_common: when typing a .ml file, return the
  compilation unit signature (inferred or from the .cmi) in addition
  to the implementation and the coercion.
  (Leandro Ostera, review by Gabriel Scherer and Thomas Refis)

- [#10045](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10045): Add libext variable to ocamltest and enable C# tests on on mingw

* [*breaking change*] [#10061](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10061), [#10078](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10078), [#10187](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10187): remove library `ocamlopttoplevel`, remove modules
  `Opttoploop`, `Opttopstart`, which are replaced by `Toploop` and `Topstart` in
  library `ocamltoplevel`, made available in native code.

- [#10124](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10124): remove duplicated code from the native toplevel, split toplevel
  implementation into the shared part (`Topcommon`, etc.) and specific ones
  (`Topeval`, `Trace`, `Topmain`).

* [*breaking change*] [#10086](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10086): add the commands `make list-parse-errors` and `make
  generate-parse-errors` to generate a set of syntactically incorrect
  sentences that covers all error states of the LR automaton. Add these
  sentences to the test suite. This can be used to evaluate the quality of the
  parser's syntax error messages and (in the future) to evaluate the impact of
  changes in the parser.

   review by Gabriel Scherer and Leo White)

- [#10170](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10170): Maintain more structural information in type-checking errors
  A mostly-internal change that preserves more information in errors
  during type checking; most significantly, it split the errors from
  unification, moregen, and type equality into three different types.
  (Antal Spector-Zabusky and Mekhrubon Tuarev, review by Leo White,
  Florian Angeletti, and Jacques Garrigue)

- [#10174](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10174): Make Tsubst more robust by avoiding strange workarounds

  flexlink-using systems.
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Sébastien Hinderer and David Allsopp,
   report by Ralph Seichter)

- [#10135](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10135): Overhaul the FlexDLL bootstrap process. It's now fully integrated
  with the default build target and controlled by --with-flexdll which allows
  externally downloaded sources for FlexDLL to be specified. A separate
  non-shared version of the runtime is built, and shared artefacts are no longer
  built twice. When bootstrapping, any flexlink in PATH is now ignored and the
  Cygwin port also supports bootstrapping FlexDLL. flexlink.opt is automatically
  built and installed as part of opt.opt/world.opt.

  Leroy)

- [#10186](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10186): configure wasn't using library link flags when searching for
  network functions on systems where they're not in libc. Fix IPv6 and
  socklen_t detection on Windows.
  (Antonin Décimo, review by David Allsopp and Sébastien Hinderer)

- [#10332](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10332), [#10333](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10333): Generate lambda/runtimedef.ml correctly in Swedish locale.

  of the constant on Unix for paths with backslashes, double-quotes and
  newlines.
  (David Allsopp, review by Florian Angeletti and Sébastien Hinderer)

- [#10471](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10471): Fix detection of arm32 architectures with musl in configure.

  the ghost components of signatures. For instance, in

    include struct class c = object end end type c

   the type `c` shadows the `class c` to avoid shadowing only the ghost type
   c introduced by the class.
