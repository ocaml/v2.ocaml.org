# OCaml 4.03.0
This page describes OCaml version **4.03.0**, released on
2016-04-25. Go [here](./) for a list of all releases and
[here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.03/) for all 4.03.*
files.

This release is availabe as multiple OPAM switches:

- 4.03.0 — Official 4.03.0 release
- 4.03.0+flambda — Official 4.03.0 release with flambda enabled
- 4.03.0+fp — Official 4.03.0 release with frame pointers
- 4.03.0+fp+flambda — Official 4.03.0 release with frame pointers and flambda enabled

## What's new?

Some of the highlights in release 4.03 are:

- A new intermediate representation, called Flambda, was added to the
  native-code compiler, along with several new optimizations over the
  Flambda representation, such as aggressive function inlining. (The
  Flambda optimizer needs to be activated at configuration time by
  `./configure -flambda`.)
- New language feature: inline records as arguments to datatype
  constructors. This makes it possible to name the arguments of a
  constructor, and use convenient record notation to access them,
  without the cost of declaring a separate record type for the
  arguments.
- The `@unboxed` and `@untagged` attributes are supported on external
  function declarations to pass parameters and results to C stub
  functions in a more efficient way.  Other attributes honored by the
  compiler include `@tailcall` and `@inline`.
- Improvements to the garbage collector, resulting in better GC
  latency (shorter GC pauses).
- Support for ephemerons, a more general form of GC finalization of
  data structures.
- The runtime system is now compiled at higher levels of C
  optimization, resulting in significant speedups for the bytecode
  interpreter.
- New native code generators supporting the PowerPC 64-bit
  architecture (in big and little-endian modes) and the IBM zSystem
  architecture.
- The whole code base (compilers, libraries and tools) is now licensed
  under the LGPL v2.1 with static linking exception.
- The ocamlbuild compilation manager was split off and lives as an
  [independent project](https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/).

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the

## ![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution

- [Source
  tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.03/ocaml-4.03.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).

- Also available in
  [.tar.xz](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.03/ocaml-4.03.0.tar.xz)
  format.

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.

- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The [INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.03/notes/INSTALL.adoc)
file of the distribution provides detailed compilation and
installation instructions.


## ![](../img/linux.gif "") Binary distributions for Linux

Binary distributions for CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu are
available
[here](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aocaml&package=ocaml).


## ![](../img/windows.gif "") Binary distribution for Microsoft Windows

Four ports of OCaml for Microsoft Windows are currently available. For
additional information, please consult the list of [portability
issues](/learn/portability.html) or the
[Windows release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.03/notes/README.win32.adoc).

- [Cygwin-based native Win32
  port](http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/). A self
  installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical user
  interface. Some features require the Cygwin environment, which the
  installer can fetch for you. However, the compilers are, and
  generate true Win32 executables, which do not require Cygwin to run.

- Microsoft-based native Win32 port. No binary distribution available
  yet; download the source distribution and compile it.

- [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)-based port. Requires Cygwin. No
  graphical user interface is provided. The compilers generate
  executables that do require Cygwin. The precompiled binaries are
  part of the Cygwin distribution; you can install them using the
  Cygwin setup tool. Alternatively, download the source distribution
  and compile it under Cygwin.

- Microsoft-based native Win64 port Same features as the
  Microsoft-based native Win32 port, but generates 64-bit code. No
  binary distribution available yet; download the source distribution
  and compile it.


## Precompiled binaries for Solaris

Available at [sunfreeware.com](http://sunfreeware.com/).


## Alternative Compilers

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* The [js_of_ocaml project](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/), an OCaml
  to Javascript compiler (stable)

* The [ocaml-java project](http://www.ocamljava.org/), an OCaml to
  Java compiler (stable)
