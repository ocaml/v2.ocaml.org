What's new
----------
Some of the highlights in release 4.10 are:

- A new best-fit allocator for the major heap which reducing both GC cost an
   memory usage.
- Immutable strings are now enforced at configuration time
- User-defined indexing operators for multidimensional arrays
- Coming soon: statmemprof, a new statistical memory profiler. The external API
  will be release next version.
- Miscellaneous improvements to the manual
- A more precise exhaustiveness check for GADTs
- Many bug fixes

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the

---------------------------------------------

- [Source
  tarball](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.10.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
- Also available in
  [.zip](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.10.0.zip)
  format.
- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.
- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The
[INSTALL](4.10/notes/INSTALL.adoc) file
of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instructions — see also the [Windows release
notes](4.10/notes/README.win32.adoc) for

Alternative Compilers
---------------------

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.
* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/) is a
  newer OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml) for
  an explanation of how it differs from `js_of_ocaml`.
* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.

Changes
-------

This is the
[changelog](4.10/notes/Changes).

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features

- [#7757](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/7757), [#1726](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/1726): multi-indices for extended indexing operators:
  `a.%{0;1;2}` desugars to `( .%{ ;.. } ) a [|0;1;2|]`
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Gabriel Radanne)

* [*breaking change*] [#1859](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/1859), [#9117](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9117): enforce safe (immutable) strings by removing
  the -unsafe-string option by default. This can be overridden by
  a configure-time option (available since 4.04 in 2016):
  --disable-force-safe-string since 4.08, -no-force-safe-since
  between 4.07 and 4.04.
  In the force-safe-string mode (now the default), the return type of the
  String_val macro in C stubs is `const char*` instead of
  `char*`. This change may break C FFI code.
  (Kate Deplaix)


- [#6662](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/6662), [#8908](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8908): allow writing "module _ = E" to ignore module expressions
  (Thomas Refis, review by Gabriel Radanne)

### Runtime system:

- [#8809](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8809), [#9292](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9292): Add a best-fit allocator for the major heap; still
  experimental, it should be much better than current allocation
  policies (first-fit and next-fit) for programs with large heaps,
  reducing both GC cost and memory usage.
  This new best-fit is not (yet) the default; set it explicitly with
  OCAMLRUNPARAM="a=2" (or Gc.set from the program). You may also want
  to increase the `space_overhead` parameter of the GC (a percentage,
  80 by default), for example OCAMLRUNPARAM="o=85", for optimal
  speed.
  (Damien Doligez, review by Stephen Dolan, Jacques-Henri Jourdan,
   Xavier Leroy, Leo White)

* [*breaking change*] [#8713](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8713), [#8940](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8940), [#9115](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9115), [#9143](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9143), [#9202](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9202), [#9251](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9251):
  Introduce a state table in the runtime to contain the global variables.
  (The Multicore runtime will have one such state for each domain.)

   This changes the status of some internal variables of the OCaml runtime;
   in many cases the header file originally defining the internal variable
   provides a compatibility macro with the old name, but programs
   re-defining those variables by hand need to be fixed.

   (KC Sivaramakrishnan and Stephen Dolan,
    compatibility hacking by David Allsopp, Florian Angeletti, Kate Deplaix,
    Jacques Garrigue, Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni and Nicolás Ojeda Bär,
    review by David Allsopp, Alain Frisch, Nicolas Ojeda Bar,
    Gabriel Scherer, Damien Doligez, and Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni)

- [#8993](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8993): New C functions caml_process_pending_actions{,_exn} in
  caml/signals.h, intended for executing all pending actions inside
  long-running C functions (requested minor and major collections,
  signal handlers, finalisers, and memprof callbacks). The function
  caml_process_pending_actions_exn returns any exception arising
  during their execution, allowing resources to be cleaned-up before
  re-raising.
  (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Jacques-Henri Jourdan,
   Stephen Dolan, and Gabriel Scherer)

* [*breaking change*] [#8691](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8691), [#8897](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8897), [#9027](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9027): Allocation functions are now guaranteed not to
  trigger any OCaml callback when called from C. In long-running C
  functions, this can be replaced with calls to
  caml_process_pending_actions at safe points.
  Side effect of this change: in bytecode mode, polling for
  asynchronous callbacks is performed at every minor heap allocation,
  in addition to function calls and loops as in previous OCaml
  releases.
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Stephen Dolan, Gabriel Scherer and
   Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni)

* [*breaking change*] [#9037](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9037): caml_check_urgent_gc is now guaranteed not to trigger any
  finaliser. In long-running C functions, this can be replaced
  with calls to caml_process_pending_actions at safe points.
  (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Jacques-Henri Jourdan and
   Stephen Dolan)


- [#8619](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8619): Ensure Gc.minor_words remains accurate after a GC.
  (Stephen Dolan, Xavier Leroy and David Allsopp,
   review by Xavier Leroy and Gabriel Scherer)

- [#8667](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8667): Limit GC credit to 1.0
  (Leo White, review by Damien Doligez)

- [#8670](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8670): Fix stack overflow detection with systhreads
  (Stephen Dolan, review by Xavier Leroy, Anil Madhavapeddy, Gabriel Scherer,
   Frédéric Bour and Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni)

* [*breaking change*] [#8711](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8711): The major GC hooks are no longer allowed to interact with the
   OCaml heap.
   (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Damien Doligez)

- [#8630](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8630): Use abort() instead of exit(2) in caml_fatal_error, and add
  the new hook caml_fatal_error_hook.
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Xavier Leroy)

- [#8641](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8641): Better call stacks when a C call is involved in byte code mode
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Xavier Leroy)

- [#8634](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8634), [#8668](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8668), [#8684](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8684), [#9103](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9103) (originally [#847](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/847)): Statistical memory profiling.
  In OCaml 4.10, support for allocations in the minor heap in native
  mode is not available, and callbacks for promotions and
  deallocations are not available.
  Hence, there is not any public API for this feature yet.
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Stephen Dolan, Gabriel Scherer
   and Damien Doligez)

- [#9268](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9268), [#9271](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9271): Fix bytecode backtrace generation with large integers present.
  (Stephen Dolan and Mark Shinwell, review by Gabriel Scherer and

### Build system:
