This page describes OCaml version **4.01.0**,
released on 2013-09-12. Go [here](./) for a list of all releases.

## What's New

Some of the highlights in release 4.01 are:

-   It is now possible to have several variant constructors or record
    fields of the same name in scope, and type information will be used
    to disambiguate which one is used -- instead of always using the
    last one. See [this
    post](http://www.lexifi.com/blog/type-based-selection-label-and-constructors)
    for a more detailed description of the feature.

-   New warnings can be activated to warn about identifiers that are
    used after having been shadowed by an `open` construct. The `open`
    keyword can be written `open!` to silence this warning (as `method!`
    silences the method warning).

-   The compiler now suggests possible typos on "unbound identifier"
    errors.

-   Infix application operators `(|>)` and `(@@)` are added to
    `Pervasives`.

-   The `-short-path` option changes the way the type-checker prints
    types to pick a short representation (eg. `string` instead of
    `StringSet.elt`).

-   This release saw a lot of polishing with sets of changes in many
    places: the type system for GADTs, compilation speed with
    `-bin-annot`, ocamlbuild, the test suite, low-level optimizations,
    etc.

## ![](../img/source.gif "")Source distribution

-   [Source tarball](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.01/ocaml-4.01.0.tar.gz)
    (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
    and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
-   Also available in
    [.tar.xz](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.01/ocaml-4.01.0.tar.xz) format.
-   [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
    OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
    installation are automated by powerful package managers.
-   You also have read-only [SVN access](svn.html) to the working
 sources and to all previous public releases.

The [INSTALL](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.01/notes/INSTALL) file of the
distribution provides detailed compilation and installation instruction.

## ![](../img/linux.gif "")Precompiled binaries for Linux

-   [Debian packages](http://packages.debian.org/ocaml).
-   [Fedora
    packages](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/ocaml/).
-   [Gentoo
    packages](http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=dev-lang;name=ocaml).


## ![](../img/macos.gif "")Precompiled binaries for MacOS X

Binary package compiled on Mac OS 10.7.5 with XCode tools 4.6.3
(probably not compatible with earlier versions of Mac OS X):

-   [for 64-bit Intel](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.01/ocaml-4.01.0-intel.dmg)
    (4.01.0)

## ![](../img/windows.gif "")Precompiled binaries for Microsoft Windows

Four ports of OCaml for Microsoft Windows are currently available. For
additional information, please consult the list of [portability
issues](/learn/portability.html) or the [Windows release
notes](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.01/notes/README.win32).

-   [Cygwin-based native Win32 port
    (4.00.0)](http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/). A self
    installer. The interactive loop comes with a simple graphical user
    interface. Some features require the Cygwin environment, which the
    installer can fetch for you. However, the compilers are, and
    generate true Win32 executables, which do not require Cygwin to run.
-   Microsoft-based native Win32 port. No binary distribution available
    yet; download the source distribution and compile it.
-   [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)-based port. Requires Cygwin. No
    graphical user interface is provided. The compilers generate
    executables that do require Cygwin. The precompiled binaries are
    part of the Cygwin distribution; you can install them using the
    Cygwin `setup` tool. Alternatively, download the source distribution
    and compile it under Cygwin.
-   Microsoft-based native Win64 port Same features as the
    Microsoft-based native Win32 port, but generates 64-bit code. No
    binary distribution available yet; download the source distribution
    and compile it.

## Precompiled binaries for Solaris

Available at [sunfreeware.com](http://sunfreeware.com/).

## Alternative Compilers

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* The [js_of_ocaml project](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/), an
 OCaml to Javascript compiler (stable)
* The [ocaml-java project](http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/), an OCaml to Java
 compiler (stable)
