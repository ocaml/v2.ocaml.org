What's new
----------

Some of the highlights in release 4.09 are:

- New optimisations, in particular for affine functions in matches, for instance
 ```ocaml
  type t = A | B | C
  let affine = function
    | A -> 4
    | B -> 3
    | C -> 2
```
- The `graphics` library was moved out of the compiler distribution.
- The `vmthread` library was removed.
- Support for compiler plugins was removed.
- Many bug fixes.

For a comprehensive list of changes and details on all new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, etc., please consult the
[changelog](#Changes).

![](../img/source.gif "") Source distribution
---------------------------------------------

- [Source
  tarball](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.09.0.tar.gz)
  (.tar.gz) for compilation under Unix (including Linux and MacOS X)
  and Microsoft Windows (including Cygwin).
- Also available in
  [.zip](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.09.0.zip)
  format.
- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is a source-based distribution of
  OCaml and many companion libraries and tools. Compilation and
  installation are automated by powerful package managers.
- The official development repo is hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml).

The
[INSTALL](4.09/notes/INSTALL.adoc) file
of the distribution provides detailed compilation and installation
instructions — see also the [Windows release
notes](4.09/notes/README.win32.adoc) for
instructions on how to build under Windows.

Alternative Compilers
---------------------

Additionally, the following projects allow you to compile OCaml code to
targets traditionally associated with other languages:

* [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) is a stable OCaml
  to JavaScript compiler.
* [Bucklescript](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/) is a
  newer OCaml to JavaScript compiler. See its
  [wiki](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/wiki/Differences-from-js_of_ocaml) for
  an explanation of how it differs from `js_of_ocaml`.
* [OCaml-java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a stable OCaml to
  Java compiler.
