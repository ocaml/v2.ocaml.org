# OCaml 4.12.1

This page describes OCaml **4.12.1**, released on Feb 24, 2021.
This is a bug-fix release of [OCaml 4.12.0](4.12.0.html).



Configuration options
---------------------

The configuration of the installed opam switch can be tuned with the
following options:

- ocaml-option-32bit: set OCaml to be compiled in 32-bit mode for 64-bit Linux and OS X hosts
- ocaml-option-afl: set OCaml to be compiled with afl-fuzz instrumentation
- ocaml-option-bytecode-only: compile OCaml without the native-code compiler
- ocaml-option-default-unsafe-string: set OCaml to be compiled without safe strings by default
- ocaml-option-flambda: set OCaml to be compiled with flambda activated
- ocaml-option-fp: set OCaml to be compiled with frame-pointers enabled
- ocaml-option-musl: set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc
- ocaml-option-nnp : set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-naked-pointers
- ocaml-option-nnpchecker: set OCaml to be compiled with --enable-naked-pointers-checker
- ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array: set OCaml to be compiled with --disable-flat-float-array
- ocaml-option-static :set OCaml to be compiled with musl-gcc -static

For instance, one can install a switch with both `flambda` and the naked-pointer checker enabled with

```
opam switch create 4.12.1+flambda+nnpchecker --package=ocaml-variants.4.12.1+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-nnpchecker
```

or with opam 2.1:

```
opam switch create 4.12.1+flambda -ocaml-variants.4.12.1+options ocaml-option-flambda
```

### Bug fixes:

- [#10107](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10107): Ensure modules compiled with -afl-instrument can still link on
  platforms without AFL support.
  (David Allsopp, review by Xavier Leroy)

- [#10294](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10294), [#10295](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10295): fix an assert-failure in pattern-matching compilation
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Thomas Refis and Luc Maranget,
   report by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

- [#10310](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10310): configure's --enable-spacetime option now causes an error rather than
  being silently ignored.
  (David Allsopp, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- [#10351](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10351): Fix DLL loading with binutils 2.36+ on mingw-w64
  (David Allsopp, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

- [#10442](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10442), [#10446](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10446): Fix regression in the toplevel to #directory caused by
  corrections and improvements to the Load_path in [#9611](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9611). #directory now
  adds the path to the start of the load path again (so files in the newly
  added directory take priority).
  (David Allsopp, report by Vasile Rotaru, review by Florian Angeletti
   and Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

- [#10449](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10449): Fix major GC work accounting (the GC was running too fast).
  (Damien Doligez, report by Stephen Dolan, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär
   and Sadiq Jaffer)

- [#10478](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10478): Fix segfault under Windows due to a mistaken initialization of thread
  ID when a thread starts.

- [#10626](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10626), [#10628](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10628): Wrong reloading of the x86-64 instruction for
  integer multiplication by a constant, causing the assembler to
  reject the ocamlopt-generated code.
  (Xavier Leroy, report by Dave Aitken, review by Vincent Laviron)

### Manual and documentation
