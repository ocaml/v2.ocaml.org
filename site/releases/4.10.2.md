# OCaml 4.10.2

This page describes OCaml **4.10.2**, released on Dec 8, 2020.  It is
an exceptional release making OCaml **4.10** available on macOS/arm64 and
fixes some compatibility issues for the mingw64 and FreeBSD/amd64 platform.

Note that those fixes were backported from OCaml 4.12: further improvement to the support
of the macOS/arm64 platform will happen on the 4.12 branch.
