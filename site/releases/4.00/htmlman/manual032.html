</P><P><TT>ocamlbuild</TT> is a tool automating the compilation of most OCaml projects with minimal
user input. Its use is not restricted to projects having a simple structure &#X2013;
the extra effort needed to make it work with the more complex projects is in
reasonable proportion with their added complexity. In practice, one will use a
set of small text files, and, if needed, an OCaml compilation module that can
fine-tune the behaviour and define custom rules.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc137"></A><A NAME="htoc217">18.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Features of <TT>ocamlbuild</TT></H2><P>

<EM>Not perfect nor complete yet, but already pretty damn useful.</EM></P><P>We were not expecting to write the ultimate compilation tool in a few man-months, however we believe we have
a tool that solves many compilation problems, especially our own, in a satisfactory way. Hence there are a
lot of missing features, incomplete options and hideous bugs lurking in <TT>ocamlbuild</TT>, and we hope that the OCaml community
will find our first try at <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> useful and hopefully help it grow into a tool that satisfies most needs of most users
by providing feedback, bug reports and patches.</P><P>The plugin API maybe somewhat lacking in maturity, as it has only been tested
by a few people. We believe a good API can only evolve under pressure from
many peers and the courage to rewrite things cleanly when time is ripe by the
developers. Most of the important functions a user will need are encapsulated
in the plugin API, which is the <TT>Ocamlbuild_plugin</TT> module pack. We
intend to keep that API backwards compatible. It may happen that intricate
projects need features not available in that module &#X2013; you may then use
functions or values directly from the core <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> modules. We ask you to report
such usage to the authors so that we may make the necessary changes to the API;
you may also want to isolate calls to the non-API parts of the <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> library
from the rest of your plugin to be able to keep the later when incompatible
changes arise.</P><P>The way that <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> handles the command-line options, the <TT>_tags</TT> file,
the target names, names of the tags, and so on, are not expected to change in
incompatible ways. We intend to keep a project that compiles without a plugin
compilable without modifications in the future.
</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc139"></A><A NAME="htoc219">18.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Using <TT>ocamlbuild</TT></H2><P>
<EM>Learn how to use <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> with short, specific, straight-to-the-point examples.</EM></P><P>The amount of time and effort spent on the compilation process of a project
should be proportionate to that spent on the project itself. It should be easy
to set up a small project, maybe a little harder for a medium-sized project,
and it may take some more time, but not too much, for a big project. Ideally
setting up a big project would be as easy as setting up a small project. However,
as projects grow, modularization techniques start to be used, and the probability
of using meta programming or multiple programming languages increases, thus making
the compilation process more delicate.</P><P><TT>ocamlbuild</TT> is intended to be very easy to use for projects, large or small, with a simple
compilation process: typing
<TT>ocamlbuild foo.native</TT> should be enough to compile the native version
of a program whose top module is <TT>foo.ml</TT> and whose dependencies are in
the same directory. As your project gets more complex, you will gradually
start to use command-line options to specify libraries to link with, then
configuration files, ultimately culminating in a custom OCaml plugin for
complex projects with arbitrary dependencies and actions.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc220">18.3.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Hygiene &amp; where is my code ?</H3><P>
Your code is in the <TT>_build</TT> directory, but <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> automatically creates
a symbolic link to the executables it produces in the current directory.
<TT>ocamlbuild</TT> copies the source files and compiles them in a separate directory
which is <TT>_build</TT> by default.</P><P>For <TT>ocamlbuild</TT>, any file that is not in the build directory is a source file.
It is not unreasonable to think that some users may have bought binary object files
they keep in their project directory. Usually binary files cluttering the project
directory are due to previous builds using other systems. <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> has so-called
&#X201C;hygiene&#X201D; rules that state that object files (<TT>.cmo</TT>, <TT>.cmi</TT>,
or <TT>.o</TT> files, for instance) must not appear outside of the build
directory. These rules are enforced at startup; any violations will be reported
and <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> will exit. You must then remove these files by hand or run, with caution,
the script <TT>sanitize.sh</TT>, which is generated in your source directory.
This script will contain commands to remove them for you.</P><P>To disable these checks, you can use the <TT>-no-hygiene</TT> flag. If you have
files that must elude the hygiene squad, just tag them with <TT>precious</TT>
or <TT>not_hygienic</TT>.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc221">18.3.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Hello, world !</H3><P>

</PRE><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc222">18.3.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Executing my code</H3><P>
You can execute your code the old-fashioned way (<TT>./hello.native</TT>).
You may also type
</P><PRE>ocamlbuild hello.native &#X2013; Caesar
</PRE><P>and it will compile and then run <TT>hello.native</TT> with the arguments following <TT>--</TT>,
which should display:
</P><PRE>% ocamlbuild hello.native &#X2013; Caesar

Hello, Caesar ! My name is _build/hello.native
</PRE><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc223">18.3.4</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;The log file, verbosity and debugging</H3><P>
By default, if you run <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> on a terminal, it will use some ANSI escape sequences
to display a nice, one-line progress indicator. To see what commands <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> has actually run,
you can check the contents of the <TT>_build/_log</TT> file. To change the name of the
log file or to disable logging, use the <TT>-log &lt;file&gt;</TT> or <TT>-no-log</TT> options.
Note that the log file is truncated at each execution of <TT>ocamlbuild</TT>.</P><P>The log file contains all the external commands that <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> ran or intended to
run along with the target name and the computed tags. With the
<TT>-verbose &lt;level&gt;</TT> option, <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> will also write more or less useful
debugging information; a verbosity level of 1 (which can also be specified
using the <TT>-verbose</TT> switch) prints generally useful information; higher
levels produce much more output.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc224">18.3.5</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Cleaning</H3><P>
<TT>ocamlbuild</TT> may leave a <TT>_build</TT> directory and symbolic links to executables in
that directory (unless when using -no-links). All of these can be removed safely
by hand, or by invoking <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> with the <TT>-clean</TT> flag.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc225">18.3.6</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Where and how to run <TT>ocamlbuild</TT>?</H3><P>
An important point is that <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> must be invoked from the root of the project,
even if this project has multiple, nested subdirectories. This is because <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> likes to store the object files in a single <TT>_build</TT> directory. You
can change the name of that directory with the <TT>-build-dir</TT> option.</P><P><TT>ocamlbuild</TT> can be either invoked manually from the UNIX or Windows shell, or
automatically from a build script or a Makefile. Unless run with the
<TT>-no-hygiene</TT> option, there is the possibility that <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> will prompt the
user for a response. By default, on UNIX systems, if <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> senses that the
standard output is a terminal, it will use a nice progress indicator using ANSI
codes, instrumenting the output of the processes it spawns to have a consistent
display. Under non-UNIX systems, or if the standard output is not a terminal,
it will run in classic mode where it will echo the executed commands on its
standard output. This selection can be overridden with the <TT>-classic-display</TT> option.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc226">18.3.7</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Dependencies</H3><P>
<EM>Dependencies are automatically discovered.</EM></P><P>Most of the value of <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> lies in the fact that it often needs no extra
information to compile a project besides the name of the top-level module.
<TT>ocamlbuild</TT> calls <TT>ocamldep</TT> to automatically find the dependencies of any
modules it wants to compile. These dependencies are dynamically incorporated
in the dependency graph, something <TT>make</TT> cannot do.
For instance, let&#X2019;s add a module <TT>Greet</TT> that implements various ways of
greeting people.
</P><PRE>% cat greet.ml
type how = Nicely | Badly;;

let greet how who =
  match how with Nicely -&gt; Printf.printf "Hello, %s !\n" who
               | Badly  -&gt; Printf.printf "Oh, here is that %s again.\n" who
;;
% cat hello.ml
open Greet

let _ =
  let name =
    if Array.length Sys.argv &gt; 1 then
      Sys.argv.(1)
    else
      "stranger"
  in
  greet
    (if name = "Caesar" then Nicely else Badly)
    name;
  Printf.printf "My name is %s\n" Sys.argv.(0)
;;
</PRE><P>Then the module <TT>Hello</TT> depends on the module <TT>Greet</TT> and <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> can
figure this out for himself &#X2013; we still only have to invoke <TT>ocamlbuild hello.native</TT>. Needless to say, this works for any number of modules.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc227">18.3.8</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Native and byte-code</H3><P>
If we want to compile byte-code instead of native, we just a target name of
<TT>hello.byte</TT> instead of <TT>hello.native</TT>, i.e., we type
<TT>ocamlbuild hello.byte</TT>.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc228">18.3.9</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Compile flags</H3><P>
To pass a flag to the compiler, such as the <TT>-rectypes</TT> option,
use the <TT>-cflag</TT> option as in:
</P><PRE>ocamlbuild -cflag -rectypes hello.native
</PRE><P>You can put multiple <TT>-cflag</TT> options, they will be passed to the compiler
in the same order. You can also give them in a comma-separated list with the
<TT>-cflags</TT> option (notice the plural):
</P><PRE>ocamlbuild -cflags -I,+lablgtk,-rectypes hello.native
</PRE><P>These flags apply when compiling, that is, when producing <TT>.cmi</TT>,
<TT>.cmo</TT>,<TT>.cmx</TT> and <TT>.o</TT> files from <TT>.ml</TT> or
<TT>.mli</TT> files.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc229">18.3.10</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Link flags</H3><P>
Link flags apply when the various object files are collected and linked into
one executable. These will typically be include directories for libraries.
They are given using the <TT>-lflag</TT> and <TT>-lflags</TT> options, which
work in the same way as the <TT>-cflag</TT> and <TT>-cflags</TT> options.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc230">18.3.11</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Linking with external libraries</H3><P>
In our third example, we use one Unix system call and functions from the <TT>num</TT>
library:
</P><PRE>% cat epoch.ml
let _ =
  let s = Num.num_of_string (Printf.sprintf "%.0f" (Unix.gettimeofday ())) in
  let ps = Num.mult_num (Num.num_of_string "1000000000000") s in
  Printf.printf "%s picoseconds have passed since January 1st, 1970.\n"
    (Num.string_of_num ps)
;;
</PRE><P>This requires linking with the <TT>unix</TT> and <TT>num</TT> modules, which is accomplished
by using the <TT>-lib unix</TT> and <TT>-lib num</TT> flags, or, alternatively, <TT>-libs unix,num</TT>:
</P><PRE>% ocamlbuild -libs nums,unix epoch.native &#X2013;
Finished, 4 targets (4 cached) in 00:00:00.
1169051647000000000000 picoseconds have passed since January 1st, 1970.
</PRE><P>You may need to add options such as <TT>-cflags -I,/usr/local/lib/ocaml/</TT>
and <TT>-lflags -I,/usr/local/lib/ocaml/</TT> if the libraries you wish to
link with are not in OCaml&#X2019;s default search path.
</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc231">18.3.12</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;The <TT>_tags</TT> files</H3><P>
Finer control over the compiler flags applied to each source file, such as
preprocessing, debugging, profiling and linking options, can be gained using
<TT>ocamlbuild</TT>&#X2019;s tagging mechanism.</P><P>Every source file has a set of tags which tells <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> what kind of file it is
and what to do with it. A tag is simply a string, usually lowercase, for
example <TT>ocaml</TT> or <TT>native</TT>. The set of tags attached to a file
is computed by applying the tagging rules to the filename. Tagging rules are
defined in <TT>_tags</TT> files in any parent directory of a file, up to the main
project directory.</P><P>Each line in the <TT>_tags</TT> file is made of a glob pattern (see subsection
<A HREF="#subsec:glob">18.3.13</A>) and a list of tags. More than one rule can apply to a file
and rules are applied in the order in which they appear in a file.
By preceding a tag with a minus sign, one may remove tags from one or more files.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Example: the built-in <TT>_tags</TT> file</H4><PRE>     &lt;**/*.ml&gt; or &lt;**/*.mli&gt; or &lt;**/*.mlpack&gt; or &lt;**/*.ml.depends&gt;: ocaml

</PRE><P>
Two special tags made from the path name of the file relative to the toplevel

<TT>foo/bar.ml</TT> those tags will be <TT>file:foo/bar.ml</TT>, and

Glob patterns have a syntax similar to those used by UNIX shells to select path
names (like <TT>foo_*.ba?</TT>). They are used in <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> to define the files

enclosed in brackets <TT>&lt;</TT> and <TT>&gt;</TT> combined using the standard

If the files of your project are held in one or more subdirectories,
<TT>ocamlbuild</TT> must be made aware of that fact using the <TT>-I</TT> or <TT>-Is</TT> options
or by adding an <TT>include</TT> tag. For instance, assume your project is made
of three subdirectories, <TT>foo</TT>, <TT>bar</TT> and <TT>baz</TT> containing
various <TT>.ml</TT> files, the main file being <TT>foo/main.ml</TT>. Then you can
either type:
</P><PRE>% ocamlbuild -Is foo,bar,baz foo/main.native

</P><PRE>&lt;foo&gt; or &lt;bar&gt; or &lt;baz&gt;: include
</PRE><P>and call
</P><PRE>% ocamlbuild foo/main.native
</PRE><P>
There are then two cases. If no other modules named <TT>Bar</TT> or
<TT>Baz</TT> exist elsewhere in the project, then you are done. Just use
<TT>Foo</TT>, <TT>Foo.Bar</TT> and <TT>Foo.Baz</TT> in your code.
Otherwise, you will need to use the plugin mechanism and define the mutual

OCaml&#X2019;s <TT>-pack</TT> option allows you to structure the contents of a

<TT>foo</TT> containing two modules <TT>bar.ml</TT> and <TT>baz.ml</TT>.
You want from these to build a module <TT>Foo</TT> containing <TT>Bar</TT>
and <TT>Baz</TT> as submodules. In the case where no modules named
<TT>Bar</TT> or <TT>Baz</TT> exist outside of <TT>Foo</TT>, to do this you
must write a file <TT>foo.mlpack</TT>, preferably sitting in the same
directory as the directory <TT>Foo</TT> and containing the list of modules
(one per line) it must contain:
</P><PRE>Bar

In a similar way than for packaged modules you can make a library by putting
it&#X2019;s contents in a file (with the mllib extension). For instance, assume you
have a two modules <TT>bar.ml</TT> and <TT>baz.ml</TT>. You want from these to
build a library <TT>foo.cmx?a</TT> containing <TT>Bar</TT> and <TT>Baz</TT>

The preferred way of compiling code suitable for debugging with <TT>ocamldebug</TT> or

Provided <TT>ocamlbuild</TT> runs in a terminal under a POSIX environment, it will
display a sophisticated progress-indicator line that graciously interacts
with the output of subcommands. This line looks like this:
</P><PRE>00:00:02 210  (180 ) main.cmx                             ONbp&#X2013;il /

been invoked; 210 is the number of external commands, typically calls to the
compiler or the like, that may or may not have been invoked; 180 is the number
of external commands that have not been invoked since their result is already
in the build directory; <TT>main.cmx</TT> is the name of the last target built;
<TT>ONbp--il</TT> is a short string that describes the tags that have been
encountered and the slash at the end is a frame from a rotating ticker. Hence,
the display line has the following structure:
</P><PRE>HH:MM:SS JOBS (CACHED) PATHNAME                           TAGS TICKER
</PRE><P>
The tag string is made of 8 indicators which each monitor a tag. These tags
are <TT>ocaml</TT>, <TT>native</TT>, <TT>byte</TT>, <TT>program</TT>,
<TT>pp</TT>, <TT>debug</TT>, <TT>interf</TT> and <TT>link</TT>. Initially,
each indicator displays a dash <TT>-</TT>. If the current target has the
monitored tag, then the indicator displays the corresponding character
(see table <A HREF="#tab:tag-chars">18.3</A>) in uppercase. Otherwise, it displays that
character in lowercase. This allows you to see the set of tags that have
been applied to files in your project during the current invocation of <TT>ocamlbuild</TT>.</P><P>Hence the tag string <TT>ONbp--il</TT> means that the current target
<TT>main.cmx</TT> has the tags <TT>ocaml</TT> and <TT>native</TT>, and that

<EM>To shell or to make ?</EM>
Traditionally, makefiles have two major functions. The first one
is the dependency-ordering, rule-matching logic used for compiling.
The second one is as a dispatcher for various actions defined using
phony targets with shell script actions. These actions include cleaning,
cleaning really well, archiving, uploading and so on. Their characteristic
is that they rely little or not on the building process &#X2013; they either need
the building to have been completed, or they don&#X2019;t need anything.
As <TT>/bin/sh</TT> scripts have been here for three to four decades and are
not going anywhere, why not replace that functionality of makefiles with a
shell script ? We have thought of three bad reasons:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Typing <TT>make</TT> to compile is now an automatism,
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">We need to share variable definitions between rules and actions,
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Escaping already way too special-character-sensitive shell code with
invisible tabs and backslashes is a dangerously fun game.
</LI></UL><P>
We also have bad reasons for not using an OCaml script to drive everything:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>Sys.command</TT> calls the <TT>/bin/sh</TT> anyway,
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Shell scripts can execute partial commands or commands with badly formed arguments.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Shell scripts are more concise for expressing... shell scripts.
</LI></UL><P>
Anyway you are of course free to use a makefile or an OCaml script to call ocamlbuild.
Here is an example shell driver script:
</P><PRE>#!/bin/sh

set -e

TARGET=epoch
FLAGS="-libs unix,nums"

<EM>This inflammatory appendix describes the frustration that led us to write <TT>ocamlbuild</TT>.</EM></P><P>Many people have painfully found that the utilities of the <TT>make</TT>
family, namely GNU Make, BSD Make, and their derivatives, fail to scale to
large projects, especially when using multi-stage compilation rules, such as
custom pre-processors, unless dependencies are hand-defined. But as your
project gets larger, more modular, and uses more diverse pre-processing tools,
it becomes increasingly difficult to correctly define dependencies by hand.
Hence people tend to use language-specific tools that attempt to extract
dependencies. However another problem then appears: <TT>make</TT> was designed
with the idea of a static dependency graph. Dependency extracting tools,
however, are typically run by a rule in <TT>make</TT> itself; this means that
make has to reload the dependency information. This is the origin of the
<TT>make clean; make depend; make</TT> mantra. This approach tends to work
quite well as long as all the files sit in a single directory and there is only
one stage of pre-processing. If there are two or more stages, then dependency
extracting tools must be run two or more times - and this means multiple
invocations of <TT>make</TT>. Also, if one distributes the modules of a large
project into multiple subdirectories, it becomes difficult to distribute the
makefiles themselves, because the language of <TT>make</TT> was not conceived
to be modular; the only two mechanisms permitted, inclusion of makefile
fragments, and invocation of other make instances, must be skillfully
coordinated with phony target names (<TT>depend1, depend2...</TT>) to insure
inclusion of generated dependencies with multi-stage programming; changes in
the structure of the project must be reflected by hand and the order of
variable definitions must be well-thought ahead to avoid long afternoons spent
combinatorially fiddling makefiles until it works but no one understands why.</P><P>These problems become especially apparent with OCaml: to ensure type safety and
to allow a small amount of cross-unit optimization when compiling native code,
interface and object files include cryptographical digests of interfaces they
are to be linked with. This means that linking is safer, but that makefile sloppiness
leads to messages such as:
</P><PRE>Files foo.cmo and bar.cmo
make inconsistent assumptions over interface Bar
</PRE><P>
The typical reaction is then to issue the mantra <TT>make clean; make
depend; make</TT> and everything compiles just fine... from the beginning. Hence
on medium projects, the programmer often has to wait for minutes instead of the
few seconds that would be taken if <TT>make</TT> could correctly guess the
small number of files that really had to be recompiled.</P><P>It is not surprising that hacking a build tool such as <TT>make</TT> to include
a programming language while retaining the original syntax and semantics gives
an improvised and cumbersome macro language of dubious expressive power. For
example, using GNU make, suppose you have a list of <TT>.ml</TT>s that you want
to convert into a list including both <TT>.cmo</TT>s and <TT>.cmi</TT>s, that
is you want to transform <TT>a.ml b.ml c.ml</TT> into <TT>a.cmi a.cmo b.cmi
b.cmo c.cmi c.cmo</TT> while preserving the dependency order which must be hand
specified for linking <SUP><A NAME="text4" HREF="#note4">2</A></SUP>.
Unfortunately <TT>$patsubst %.ml, %.cmi %.cmo, a.ml b.ml c.ml</TT> won&#X2019;t
work since the %-sign in the right-hand of a <TT>patsubst</TT> gets
substituted only once. You then have to delve into something that is hardly
lambda calculus: an intricate network of <TT>foreach</TT>, <TT>eval</TT>,
<TT>call</TT> and <TT>define</TT>s may get you the job done, unless you chicken
out and opt for an external <TT>awk</TT>, <TT>sed</TT> or <TT>perl</TT> call.
People who at this point have not lost their temper or sanity usually resort to
metaprogramming by writing Makefile generators using a mixture of shell and m4.
One such an attempt gave something that is the nightmare of wannabe package
maintainers: it&#X2019;s called <TT>autotools</TT>.</P><P>Note that it is also difficult to write <TT>Makefiles</TT> to build object
files in a separate directory. It is not impossible since the language of
<TT>make</TT> is Turing-complete, a proof of which is left as an exercise.
Note that building things in a separate directory is not necessarily a young
enthusiast&#X2019;s way of giving a different look and feel to his projects &#X2013; it may
be a good way of telling the computer that <TT>foo.mli</TT> is generated by
<TT>ocamlyacc</TT> using <TT>foo.mly</TT> and can thus be removed.
