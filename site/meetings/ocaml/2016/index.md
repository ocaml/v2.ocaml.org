OCaml 2016
==========

**The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop**: Nara, Japan, Friday 23rd September 2016.

Colocated with [ICFP 2016](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2016/),
the day after the [ML family workshop](http://www.mlworkshop.org/ml2016/).

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together industrial users of
OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending the language,
type system and tools.
Previous editions have been colocated with ICFP 2012 in
[Copenhagen](http://oud.ocaml.org/2012/), ICFP 2013 in
[Boston](../2013), ICFP 2014 in [Gothenburg](../2014),
ICFP 2015 in [Vancouver](../2015),
following the OCaml Meetings that ran until [2011](../2011).

Call for papers (past)
======================

Scope
-----

Discussions will focus on the practical aspects of OCaml programming and
the nitty gritty of the tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes.
Thus, we aim to solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use
or development of the language and of its programming environment,
including, for example:

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not limited to)
  GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
  situations.

Submission
----------

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
meeting, but no formal proceedings.  Slides of presentations will be
available online from the workshop homepage.  The presentations will
likely be recorded, and made available at a later time.

To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2
pages long) [by following this link](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=oud2016),
providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the talk: the
problems that are addressed, the technical solutions or methods that are
proposed.  If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup, we
will do our best to accommodate you.

Schedule
--------

- Monday 20th June 2016 (any time zone): Talk proposal submission deadline
- Monday 18th July 2016: Author notification
- Friday 23rd September 2016: OCaml workshop

ML family workshop and post-proceedings
---------------------------------------

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with general
issues of the ML-style programming and type systems, and is seen as more
research-oriented.  Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop,
which we are keen to explore, for instance by having a common session.
The authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged
to mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

There may be a combined post-conference proceedings of selected papers
from the two workshops.
