# OCaml Users Meeting 2011

__Date: Friday 15th April 2011__
Location: Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France

This event will take place in Paris. The venue is in Telecom ParisTech
(former ENST, the place of the first OCaml Meeting).

The OCaml Meeting is the a place where OCaml enthusiasts can meet and
discuss various subjects ranging from webservers to parser/lexer of
natural languages in OCaml. Most of the topics focus on practical
OCaml subjects (libraries or applications) but broadening the field is
allowed.

The meeting is kindly sponsored by the
[CAML consortium](/consortium/), so the lunch and
the coffee breaks are free.

### The core Caml system: status report and challenges, by Xavier Leroy

Xavier Leroy, senior research scientist at INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt,
leads the development team for the core Caml system.

This talk will briefly review ongoing work on the core Caml system and
discuss some medium to long-term challenges, both technical and
organizational.

### OASIS-DB: a CPAN for OCaml, by Sylvain Le Gall

OASIS-DB is a set of tools and a webserver that helps to manage OASIS
enabled softwares and libraries to live together. It uses OASIS data
to build a database and to understand the link between each
packages. It also provides a backup site for tarball. The webserver is
built on top of Ocsigen and Lwt.

This talk will show the architecture of OASIS and OASIS-DB and
demonstrate some of its low paperwork publication scheme: upload your
tarball to the website and let all others download, compile and
install it using only 2 commands.

Sylvain Le Gall is an OCaml consultant working at OCamlCore SARL.

### js_of_ocaml: Compiling Ocaml bytecode to Javascript, by Jérôme Vouillon

[Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml) is a compiler of OCaml
bytecode to Javascript. It makes it possible to run Ocaml programs in
a Web browser. Its key features are the following:

- The whole language, and most of the standard library are supported.
- The generated code runs very fast
- The compiler is easy to install: it only depends on Findlib and Lwt.
- The generated code is independent of Eliom and the Ocsigen server. You can use it with any Web server.
- You can use a standard installation of OCaml to compile your programs. In particular, you do not have to recompile a library to use it with Js_of_ocaml. You just have to link your program with a specific library to interface with the browser APIs.
- Binding Javascript libraries is very easy

In this talk we will show you the main features and some examples.

Jérôme Vouillon is a computer science researcher at
[PPS](http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/) and [IRILL](http://www.irill.org/)
(CNRS), member of the [Ocsigen](http://ocsigen.org/) team.

### Client/server Web applications with Eliom, by Vincent Balat

Ocsigen Eliom is an extension for the Web server of the Ocsigen
project allowing to write Web applications in Ocaml. Eliom 1 made very
easy to write reliable Web sites where pages are computed on server
side. Thanks to the js_of_ocaml compiler, it is now possible to run
OCaml programs in a browser. Eliom 2.0, that will be released in very
few weeks, will make possible to mix both, and write client/server Web
applications fully in OCaml, in very few lines of code. A
client/server program is written as a single OCaml application. Eliom
handles the communication between the client and the server
automatically in both directions, and your application is fully
integrated in your Web site, that is: you keep the usual Web
interaction (with links, forms, and URLs) during the execution of the
client side program!

In this talk I will show how to write an example application.

### Using OCaml to generate 198,278 lines of C, by Richard Jones

We use OCaml in the [libguestfs project](http://libguestfs.org/) to
generate large amounts of boilerplate C code. This short talk (10
mins) will explain what the problem that existing projects such as
[libvirt](http://libvirt.org/) suffered from and how we successfully
solved it, and what difficulties remain.

### MirageOS, by Anil Madhavapeddy

Mirage is an open-source operating system for constructing secure,
high-performance, reliable network applications across a variety of
cloud computing platforms. OCaml code can be developed on a normal OS
such as Linux and then compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised
OS kernel that runs under the Xen hypervisor (and in the future, KVM
or VMWare). Mirage is based around the OCaml language, with syntax
extensions and libraries that are easy to use during development, and
map directly into operating system constructs when being compiled for
production deployment.

### Developing Frama-C Plug-ins in OCaml, by Julien Signoles

[Frama-C](http://frama-c.com/) is an extensible and collaborative
platform dedicated to source-code analysis of C software. It is fully
developed in OCaml. Any OCaml developer can extend the platform with a
new plug-in in order to add new analyzers or functionalities. This
talk will give a survey of Frama-C and show how to implement a new
plug-in in OCaml.

### JoCaml, by Luc Maranget

[JoCaml](http://jocaml.inria.fr/) is an extension of Objective Caml
for concurrent and distributed programming. The last released version
of JoCaml features an extended library intended to facilitate the
programming of master/slave distributed applications aware of failures
and machine heterogeneity, and the control of forked programs. I'll
illustrate this new functionalities by the means of simple examples,
where JoCaml acts as a coordination language.

### The Eternal Solution for Memoisation: Ephemerons, by François Bobot

Memoization is a powerful tool for writing neat programs but yet
efficient ones. It stores previous function results for latter use. To
avoid memory leaks, a perfect memoization technique would let a
function result be reclaimed as soon as the function argument is
reclaimed. It can be proved that a perfect solution cannot be
implemented with the current Ocaml runtime. We propose a modification
to the Ocaml runtime which provides Hayes's ephemerons. It is then
possible to implement perfect memoization tables.

### OCAPIC: programming PIC microcontrollers with Objective Caml, by Benoît Vaugon and Philippe Wang

OCAPIC provides means to program PIC microcontrollers with Objective
Caml (with no language restrictions, only library changes). Very tight
PIC µC resources (only 4KB of volatile memory, at most) made this task
a great challenge that has been successfully addressed.

OCAPIC includes OCamlClean, a tool to reduce bytecode binaries by
eliminating dead code (works with any binary produced by compiler
ocamlc).

### Ideas for a Modern OCaml Web Portal by Ashish Agarwal

OCaml lacks the web presence it deserves. The purpose of this talk is
to foster discussion of what we as a community want from a modern web
portal for OCaml, and how we can begin implementing it. The discussion
will be guided by a presentation covering: desired content and design,
technological implementation choices, and management of such an
effort.

Ashish Agarwal is a Research Scientist at New York University, where
he uses OCaml to build bioinformatics software.
