OCaml 2014
==========

**The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop**  
Gothenburg, Sweden, September 5, 2014  
Colocated with [ICFP 2014](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2014/)

News
----

-   May 7, 2014: Sent the last CFP. Deadline is on May 19! Specifically, May 19, 23:59 Samoa Standard Time.
-   April 24, 2014: The [submission
    site](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocaml2014) is
    now open.
-   February 10, 2014: [workshop announcement](cfp.html). 

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together industrial users of
OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending the language,
type system and tools.
Previous editions have been colocated with ICFP 2012 in
[Copenhagen](http://oud.ocaml.org/2012/), and ICFP 2013 in
[Boston](../2013), following the OCaml Meetings that ran until [2011](../2011).

Scope
-----

Discussions will focus on the practical aspects of OCaml programming and
the nitty gritty of the tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes.
Thus, we aim to solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use
or development of the language and of its programming environment,
including, for example:

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures
- practical type system improvements, such as (but not limited to) 
 GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types
- new library or application releases, and their design rationales
- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements
- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
 situations.

Submission
----------

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
meeting, but no formal proceedings. Slides of presentations will be
available online from the workshop homepage. The presentations will
likely be recorded, and made available at a later time.

To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2 pages
long) at
[EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocaml2014),
providing a clear statement of what will be brought by the talk: the
problems that are addressed, the technical solutions or methods that
are proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special
setup, we will do our best to accommodate you.

Schedule
--------

- Abstract Submission Deadline: Monday, May 19, 2014
- Notification to Speakers: Monday, June 30, 2014
- Workshop: Friday, September 5, 2014

ML family workshop and post-proceedings
---------------------------------------

The [ML family workshop](http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/ML14.html), held on
the previous day, deals with general issues
of the ML-style programming and type systems, and is seen as more research
oriented. Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop, which we are
keen to explore, for instance by having a common session.  The authors who
feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to mention it at
submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

As another form of cooperation, combined post-proceedings of selected
papers from the two workshops will be published in the [Electronic
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science](http://www.eptcs.org) series. The Program
Committees shall invite interested authors of selected presentations to
expand their abstract for inclusion in the proceedings. The submissions
would be reviewed according to the standards of the publication.
