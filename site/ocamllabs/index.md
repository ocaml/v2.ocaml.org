#  OCaml Labs
The goal of [OCaml Labs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/) is
to push OCaml and functional programming forward as a platform, making
it a more effective tool for all users, including significant industrial
users, while at the same time growing the appeal of the language,
broadening its applicability and popularity. This will be achieved by a
combination of technological advancements, creation of community
infrastructure, and public communications. A core principle of OCaml
Labs is that all the work will be freely released under open-source
licenses, and efforts made to integrate work upstream (e.g to INRIA, who
originally developed and have maintained OCaml since its release in
1996).

You can support OCaml via a charitible donation to OCaml Labs, which is
a project within the [Faculty of Computer
Science](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.
Cambridge is a registered Charity and donations are often a
tax-efficient and effective way to help expand your organisation's use
of functional programming and ensure the long-term future of OCaml. If
you'd like to discuss making a donation, please contact [Anil
Madhavapeddy](mailto:anil@recoil.org?subject=Donating%A0to%A0%0AOCaml%A0Labs)
for more information.
