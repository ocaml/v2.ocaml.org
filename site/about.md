# About This Site
*Table of contents*

## Aims

OCaml.org is a community driven website, created by and for OCaml
developers and those interested in the language. The overall goals of
the website are:

* To be the public face of the OCaml language
* To be a useful resource to current OCaml users
* To be a place that those current users can point others to for
  info/updates
* To be useful for the wider group of casual visitors, new users and
  the programming community.

The reasoning for the above is as follows. The core group (current
users) must find utility from the site or there's less drive for them
to visit or contribute. When those users get something useful from the
site, then they're more likely to remember to point others to it.
Once the first two groups are catered for then the site starts
becoming useful to the wider crowd of people who are generally
interested and find their way to the site themselves.

## Governance of this website

A small team of individuals volunteer their time to manage and develop
the site. These volunteers maintain an overview of the site and ensure
that the above aims are being met, while providing a consistent
experience for all visitors. Among other things, their
responsibilities cover the content, presentation, usability,
infrastructure and tooling for the site. At the time of writing, the
'www.ocaml.org' team consists of:

- [Ashish Agarwal](http://ashishagarwal.org)
- [Amir Chaudhry](http://amirchaudhry.com)
- [Louis Gesbert](http://github.com/AltGr/)
- [Fabrice Le Fessant](http://www.lefessant.net/)
- [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org)
- [David Sheets](https://github.com/dsheets)
- [Christophe Troestler](https://github.com/Chris00)
- [Philippe Wang](http://philippewang.info/CL/)

People may be added or removed from this group by consensus decision
and membership is primarily based on contributions to the site or the
infrastructure behind it. As the site and community grows, a more
formal governance structure may be required and any changes or
discussions regarding this will take place on the [infrastructure
mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure/), with
relevant notifications to the main
[caml-list](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/).

### Governance of the OCaml.org domain

The public facing website is just one of the
[Projects](https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki) associated with the
OCaml.org domain name. The domain name has it's own
[governing document](/governance.html), which you should refer to for how
sub-domains are handled.

## How to Contribute

OCaml.org is currently managed through
[GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/) and the [infrastructure
mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure/). To
submit content to the site, please fork the site and use GitHub's pull
request mechanism to submit content. It will be reviewed by one of the
ocaml.org team members and merged. We aim for merged content to be
live within a few minutes.


### Contribution Guidelines

* Please fork the repo and use the Pull Request system to submit
  changes.  To add or modify content, you can also click the pen in
  the top right corner which will take you to the corresponding GitHub
  page.  There you can edit it and perform a pull request (GitHub will
  take care of doing the fork for you).
* Please don't add large files, you should put them elsewhere and link
  to them. It is possible to host some files in the separate
  [ocaml.org-media](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-media) repo.
* Please be aware that Pull Requests are prioritised over issues.
* Please be aware that content submitted will be licensed as stated in the
  [license](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file.
* If you are submitting substantial changes please do try building
  them locally first (run `make`).
* If you're not sure how to get involved, help us with [open
  issues](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues)!
* Please remember that the site is managed by volunteers!

As the [list of contributors](contributors.html) is automatically
generated from the Git logs, make sure you commit with your real first
and last names ([set up your identity](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#Your-Identity)
in Git before committing).


### Conflict Resolution

In most cases, content and fixes can simply be merged. On the rare
occasions, where there may be disagreement, we will do the following:

* The specific issue(s) will need to be articulated so it is clear
  what needs to be discussed.

* Other members of the ocaml.org team will be asked to join the
  discussion on the pull request.

* If the discussion cannot be resolved quickly, then the pull request
  should be closed and the discussion point raised on the
  [infrastructure mailing
  list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure/), where other
  members can also offer their viewpoint.

In general, we expect to generate consensus among the community to
resolve any conflicts.
