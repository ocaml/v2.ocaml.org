# OCaml logo

Web sites related to the OCaml language or that use it are encouraged to
incorporate the OCaml logo somewhere in their page to indicate their
support for OCaml development. The logo should be linked to the OCaml
website, [ocaml.org](//ocaml.org/).
The logo is available in
[several formats](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo/tree/master/Colour) and
[colors](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo).  Two versions are
displayed below.  To include one of them on your web page, just copy
and paste the associated HTML code and tweak it (e.g. adapt the `width`
or change the part after `logo/` to match the one of the file you
want in the [repository](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo)).
The OCaml logo is released under a
[liberal license](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The following [SVG file](/img/OCaml_Sticker.svg) is suitable to
[make stickers](https://twitter.com/ocamllabs/status/761191421680422912).
It is released under the same
[liberal license](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/LICENSE.md) as
the logo so do not hesitate to print your own stickers to promote
OCaml!

Before printing some stickers, it would be great if you
[tweeted it](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OCaml%20stickers&src=typd) with
tags `#OCaml stickers` so that other interested people in your area can
get in touch with you!
