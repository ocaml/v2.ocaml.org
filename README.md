OCAML.ORG PROJECT
=================
This is the source code implementing the ocaml.org
website. Information here is relevant only to developers and content
contributors. End-users of the website should simply visit the
website, which is hosted at http://ocaml.org.


DEPENDENCIES
============
Building the html pages requires:

* bash
* curl
* rsync
* GNU make
* ocaml >= 3.12.0 (the presence of ocamlopt is required)
* ocamlfind
* mpp >= 0.1.2
* omd >= 0.7.5
* netstring, netclient, equeue-ssl, and rss (for rss2html.ml)

If you use opam, the OCaml packages above can be installed by running:

    opam install ocamlfind mpp omd ssl ocamlnet ocamlrss

Note that you need `libssl-dev` to be able to compile and use `ssl`.
`libssl-dev` is the name of a debian package, if you're using another system,
it might be available under a different name.

BUILD
=====
The site consists only of static pages, so can be built and run
entirely on a local machine without dependencies on external file or
database servers. Simply run:

    make

This will generate a new folder `ocaml.org` that contains the full
website.  Note that building the site will attempt to connect to the
internet to download the news and latest email conversations.  As
usual, use `make clean` to delete the files generated by the
compilation.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================
`site` — Main content of the site. Most files are in Markdown syntax
         and converted to HTML by the build scripts.

`template` — Templates governing the overall look and feel of the
             site. These are applied to the pages within site/ when
             the site is built. References to templates within site
             pages should be of the form `template/template-file-name`
             because the build script assumes this directory
             structure.

`script` — Scripts used to build the site.
