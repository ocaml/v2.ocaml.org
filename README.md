OCAML.ORG PROJECT
=================
This is the source code implementing the ocaml.org
website. Information here is relevant only to developers and content
contributors. End-users of the website should simply visit the
website, which is hosted at http://ocaml.org.


DEPENDENCIES
============
Building the html pages requires:

* bash
* curl
* rsync
* GNU make
* ocaml >= 4.01.0 (the presence of ocamlopt is required)
* camlp4orf (comes with the compiler in OPAM, in `camlp4-extra` in Debian)
* ocamlfind
* mpp >= 0.1.2
* omd >= 0.9.7
* opam2web >= 1.3.1
* uri >= 1.3.11
* netstring, netclient, equeue-ssl, and rss (for rss2html.ml)
* lablgtk2 (optional, for the Gtk tutorial)

Implicit dependencies exist and may not be on this list (for instance, opam2web depends on quite a set of packages, so it's strongly adviced to use opam to compute and install automatically such packages).

If your opam environment isn't using OCaml 4.01.0, you may switch to it by using this command:

    opam switch 4.01.0

If you use opam (>= 1.1), the OCaml packages above can be installed by
running:

    opam install ocamlfind mpp omd ssl ocamlnet ocamlrss opam2web uri

Note that you need `libssl-dev` to be able to compile and use `ssl`.
`libssl-dev` is the name of a debian package, if you're using another system,
it might be available under a different name.

BUILD
=====
The site consists only of static pages, so can be built and run
entirely on a local machine without dependencies on external file or
database servers. Simply run:

    make

(or `make -j` for a faster build on multicore machines.
NB: you might need to limit the number of forks e.g `make -j 8`
[ref](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/462#issuecomment-40318537)).

This will generate a new folder `ocaml.org` that contains the full
website.  Note that building the site will attempt to connect to the
internet to download the news and latest email conversations.  As
usual, use `make clean` to delete the files generated by the
compilation.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================
`site` — Main content of the site. Most files are in Markdown syntax
         and converted to HTML by the build scripts.

`template` — Templates governing the overall look and feel of the
             site. These are applied to the pages within site/ when
             the site is built. References to templates within site
             pages should be of the form `template/template-file-name`
             because the build script assumes this directory
             structure.

`script` — Scripts used to build the site.
